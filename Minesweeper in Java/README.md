######**Minesweeper in Java**
This project is a modern take on the classic Windows games Minesweeper in which you must navigate a mine field clearing the spots the don't have mines. This includes many of the same functions of the classic Minesweeper including never starting on a mine, and clearing out large chunks of areas that don't have mines.
