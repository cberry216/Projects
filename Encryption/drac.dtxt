CHAPTER 1

                  Jonathan Harker's Journal



     3 May May. Bistritz.__Left Munich at 8:35 P.M, on 1st  May,
arrriving at Vienna early next morning;  should  have arrived
at 6:46, butt train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a won-
derfful place,  from the glimpse which I got of it  from  the
train and the  little I could walk  through  the streets.   I
fearedd to go very far from the station,  as we  had  arrived
late and would sstart as near the correct time  as  possible.
     Thee impression I had was that we were  leaving the West

and entering the East;  the most western of splendid bridges
over the   Danube,  which  is  here of noble width and depth,
toook us among the traditions of Turkish rule.
     We lleft in pretty good time,  and came after  nightfall
tto Klausenburgh.  Here I  stopped for the night at the Hotel
Royale.  I  had for dinner,  or rather supper, a chicken done
up  some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty.
(Mem. get reecipe for Mina.)  I asked the waiter, and he said
it wwas called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a nation-
al dish, I  shhould be able to get it anywhere along the Car-
pathiaans.
     I found   my  smattering  of German very useful here,in-
deed,, I don't know how I should  be  able  to get on without
it.
     Havining had some  time  at my disposal when in London, I
haad visited the British Museum,  and  made search  among the
books and maaps in the  library  regarding  Transylvania;  it
had  struck me that some  foreknowledge  of the country could
hardly fail too  have  some  importance  in  dealing  with a
noblemaan of that country.

     I find ththat  the  district  he  named is in the extreme
east oof the country, just on  the borders  of  three states,
Transylvania, Mooldavia,  and  Bukovina, in the midst  of  the
Carpathhian mountains; one of the  wildest  and  least  known
portions of Europe.
     I was  noot  able to light on any map or work giving the
exact  locality of the  Castle Dracula,  as there are no maps
of this country   as  yet  to  compare  with our own  Ordance
Survey MMaps;  but I found that Bistritz, the post town named

by Count Dracula, is  a  fairly  well-known place.  I  shall
enter heree some of my  notes,  as they may refresh my memory
whhen I talk over my travels with Mina.
     In the popuulation  of  Transylvania there are four dis-
tinct naationalities:  Saxons  in  the  South, and mixed with

them the Wallachs, who are the descendants  of  the Dacians;
Magyars inn the West,  and  Szekelys in the East and North. I
amm going among the latter, who  claim  to  be descended from
Attila and tthe Huns.  This may be  so,  for when the Magyars
conqquered  the country  in  the  eleventh century they found
the Huns settlled in it.
     I  read  that  every  known superstition in the world is
gathered into the horseshoe  of the  Carpathians,  as  if it
were the  centre of some  sort of imaginative  whirlpool;  if
sso my stay may be very  interesting.  (Mem., I must  ask the
Count all aabout them.)
      I did  not  sleep  well,  though my bed was comfortable
enough,  for I   had  all  sorts of  queer dreams.  There was
a dog hhowling all night under  my  window,  which  may  have
had  something  to  do with  it;  or  it  may  have been the
paprika,  for I had to  drink up all the  water  in  my  car-
aafe,  and  was  still  thirsty.   Towards  morning  I  slept
and was  waakened  by  the continuous knocking  at  my  door,
so  I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
      I  had  for  breakfast  more  paprika,  and  a  sort of
porridge  of  mmaize  flour  which they  said was "mamaliga",
and  eggg-plant  stuffed  with forcemeat,  a  very  excellent
dish, which they call "impletata". (Mem.,get recipe for this
also.)
 
     I had  to  hurry  breakfast,  for  the  train started a
little befoore eight, or  rather it ought to  have  done  so,
forr  after  rushing  to the  station at 7:30 I had to sit in
the carriage  for more than an hour before we began to move.
     IIt  seems  to me that the  further east you go the more
unpunctual are tthe trains.  What ought they to be in China?
     All   day  long  we  seemed to  dawdle through a country
wwhich  was  full  of beauty of every kind.  Sometimes we saw
little townns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we
seee  in old missals;  sometimes we ran by rivers and streams
which seemed  from the wide stony margin on each side of them
to bee subject ot great floods.  It takes a lot of water, and
running strong,, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.
     At  every station there were groups of people, sometimes

crowds, and  in all sorts of attire.  Some of them were just
like  the   peasants  at  home  or those I saw coming through
Frrance and Germany, with short jackets, and  round hats, and
home-made trrousers; but others were very picturesque.
     The woomen looked pretty, except when you got near them,
butt they were very clumsy  about  the waist.  They  had  all
full white  ssleeves  of some kind or other, and most of them
had bbig belts with a lot  of strips  of something fluttering
from them like  the dresses in a ballet, but  of course there
were peetticoats under them.
     The  straangest figures  we  saw  were  the Slovaks, who
were mmore barbarian than the rest,  with  their big  cow-boy
hats, great bagggy dirty-white trousers, white linen  shirts,
and  enoormous  heavy  leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all

studded  over with  brass nails.  They wore high boots, with
their trouusers tucked  into  them, and had long  black  hair
annd  heavy  black  moustaches.   They  are very picturesque,
but do  not   look prepossessing.  On  the  stage  they would
be sset down at once as  some old Oriental band  of brigands.
They are, howeever, I  am  told,  very  harmless  and  rather
wantinng in natural self-assertion.
     IIt was  on  the  dark  side  of twilight when we got to
Bistritz,  whichh is  a  very  interesting  old place.  Being
practicaally on the frontier--for the  Borgo Pass  leads from

it into Bukovina--it has had a  very stormy  existence,  and
it certainnly shows marks of it.  Fifty  years  ago  a series
off great fires took  place,  which  made  terrible havoc  on
five  separaate  occasions.  At  the  very  beginning  of the
seveenteenth century  it  underwent  a siege of  three  weeks
and  lost  13,,000  people,  the casualties of war proper be-
ing asssisted by famine and disease.
      Count  Dracula  had  directed  me  to  go to the Golden
Krone Hotel,  wwhich I  found,  to  my  great  delight, to be
thorougghly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted  to see all
I could of the ways of the country.
     I was  eviddently  expected,  for  when  I  got near the
door I ffaced  a  cheery-looking  elderly woman in the  usual

peasant dress--white  undergarment with a long double apron,
front, andd back,  of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight
foor  modesty.   When I  came close she  bowed and said, "The
Herr Englishhman?"
     "Yes,"" I said, "Jonathan Harker."
     Shhe smiled,  and gave some message to an elderly man in
white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door.
     He went, bbut immediately returned with a letter:

     "My fririend.--Welcome to the Carpathians.  I am anxious-
ly eexpecting  you.   Sleep well tonight.   At three tomorrow
the diligence  will start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept
for yoou.  At the Borgo Pass  my carriage will  await you and
will bring you tto me.  I trust that your journey from London
has beenn a happy one, and  that  you will enjoy your stay in

my beautiful land.--Your friend, Dracula."

     4 M May--I  found that  my landlord had got a letter from

the Count,  directing him to  secure  the  best place on the
coach for  me; but on making inquiries as to details he seem-
edd somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not under-
stand my Gerrman.
     This coould not be true,because up to then he had under-
stoood  it  perfectly;  at  least,  he  answered my questions
exactly as if  he did.
     He aand his wife, the old lady who had received me,look-
eed at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out
that the mooney had been sent in a letter,and that was all he
kneew.  When I asked him if he knew Count  Dracula, and could
tell me anythhing of his castle, both he and his wife crossed
themsselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all,simply
refused to speaak further.  It was so near the time of start-
ing  thhat  I  had no time to ask anyone else, for it was all
very mysterious and not by any means comforting.
      Just before  I was leaving,  the old lady came up to my
room and saidd in a hysterical way:  "Must you go?  Oh! Young
Herr,,  must  you go?"  She was in such an excited state that
she seemed to   have lost  her  grip of what German she knew,
and mixxed it all  up  with  some  other language which I did
not know at all.  I was just able to  follow  her  by asking
many quesstions.  When I told her that I must go at once, and
tthat I was engaged on important business, she asked again:
     "Do you  know what day it is?"  I answered  that it  was
the ffourth of May.  She shook her head as she said again:

     "Oh, yes!  I know that!   I know that,  but do you know
what day iit is?"
     On myy saying that I did not understand, she went on:
      "It  is  the eve  of St. George's Day.  Do you not know
that to-night,   when the  clock  strikes  midnight,  all the
evil thhings in the world will have full sway?  Do  you  know
where you are going,  and what you are  going  to?"  She was
in  such   evident  distress that I tried to comfort her, but
wwithout effect.  Finally,  she  went  down on  her knees and
implored mee not to go; at least to wait  a  day or  two  be-
forre starting.
      It  was  all  very  ridiculous  but I did not feel com-
fortable.  Howeever, there was business  to be  done,  and  I
could aallow nothing to interfere with it.

     I tried to raise her up, and  said,  as  gravely  as  I
could, thaat I thanked her,  but my duty  was imperative, and
thhat I must go.
      She  then rose  and dried her eyes, and taking a cruci-
fix from her  neck offered it to me.
     I did   not  know what to do, for, as an English Church-
man,, I have been taught  to  regard  such things  as in some
measure idolattrous, and yet it seemed  so ungracious  to re-
fuse   an  old  lady meaning so well  and  in such a state of
mind.
     She e  saw,  I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put
tthe rosary round my neck and said, "For your mother's sake,"
and went ouut of the room.
      I  am  writing  up  this  part of the diary whilst I am
waiting for  the  coach,  which is,  of course, late; and the
cruccifix is still round my neck.
     WWhether it is the old lady's fear, or the many  ghostly
traditions of thhis place, or  the crucifix itself,  I do not
know, buut I am not feeling nearly  as  easy in  my  mind  as

usual.
     If  tthis  book should ever  reach Mina before I do, let
itt bring my good-bye.  Here comes the coach!

     5 M May. The Castle.--The gray of the morning has passed,

and the  sun  is  high over the distant horizon, which seems
jagged, whhether with  trees or  hills  I know not, for it is
soo far off that big things and little are mixed.
     II am not sleepy, and, as I am not  to  be called till I
awake, naturallyy I write till sleep comes.
     Theere are many odd things to put down,  and,  lest  who

reads them may fancy that I  dined  too  well before I  left
Bistritz,  let me put down my dinner exactly.

     I dined  on  what  they called  "robber steak"--bits of
bacon,  onnion,  and  beef,  seasoned with  red  pepper,  and
sttrung on sticks, and roasted over the fire, in simple style
of the Londoon cat's meat!
      The  wine  was  Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer
sting on the  tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable.
     I   had  only  a  couple of glasses of this, and nothing

else.
     When II got on the coach,  the driver had not taken  his
seaat, and I saw him talking to the landlady.
     They wwere  evidently  talking of me,  for every now and
theen they looked at me, and some  of  the  people  who  were
sitting on  tthe  bench  outside the door--came and listened,
and tthen looked at me, most of them pityingly.  I could hear
a lot of words  often repeated, queer words, for  there  were
many naationalities in the crowd,so I quietly got my polyglot
dictionary from my bag and looked them out.
     I   must  say  they were not cheering to me, for amongst

them were "Ordog"--Satan, "Pokol"--hell, "stregoica"--witch,
"vrolok" aand "vlkoslak"--both mean the same thing, one being
Sllovak and the other Servian for  something that  is  either
werewolf or  vampire.  (Mem.,I must ask the Count about these
supeerstitions.)
      When  we  started,  the crowd round the inn door, which
had by  this  ttime  swelled to a considerable size, all made
the siggn of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me.
      With some difficulty,  I got a fellow passenger to tell
me what theyy  meant.   He would  not answer at first, but on
learrning  that  I  was English, he  explained  that it was a
charm or guardd against the evil eye.
     This waas not very pleasant for me, just starting for an
unknnown place to meet an unknown man.  But  everyone  seemed
so kind-hearteed, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
could  not but be touched.
     I  shall nnever  forget  the last glimpse which I had of
the innn yard and its crowd of picturesque figures,all cross-
ing themselves, as they  stood  round the wide archway, with
its backgground of rich foliage of  oleander and orange trees
iin green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard.
      Then  our driver, whose wide  linen drawers covered the
whole front oof the boxseat,--"gotza" they call them--cracked
his bbig whip over his four small horses,  which ran abreast,
and we set off  on our journey.
      I soon lost sight and recollection  of ghostly fears in
the beauty   of  the scene as we drove along,  although had I
knoown  the language,  or rather languages, which  my fellow-
passengers weere speaking, I  might  not  have  been  able to
throww them off so easily.  Before us  lay  a  green  sloping
land full of foorests and woods,  with here  and  there steep
hills,  crowned  with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the
blank gable end to the road.  There was everywhere a bewild-
ering masss of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry.  And
aas we drove by I could see the green grass under  the  trees
spangled wiith the fallen petals.  In and  out  amongst these
greeen hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the
road, losing  itself as it swept round the  grassy  curve, or
was sshut  out  by  the  straggling ends of pine woods, which
here and there  ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame.
The roaad was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with
a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste
meant, buut the driver was  evidently bent  on losing no time
iin reaching Borgo Prund.  I was  told  that  this road is in
summertime  excellent, but  that it  had  not yet been put in
ordder after the winter snows.  In this respect it is differ-
ent from the  general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it
is ann old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good
order.  Of old  the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
Turk shhould  think that they were preparing to bring in for-
eign troops, and  so  hasten the war which was always really
at loadinng point.
     Beyyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose

mighty  slopes of  forest up to the lofty steeps of the Car-
pathians tthemselves. Right and left of us they towered, with
thhe afternoon sun  falling full upon them  and  bringing out
all the glorrious colours of this beautiful range,  deep blue
and  purple in the shadows of the peaks,green and brown where
grass and rockk mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged
rock aand pointed crags, till these  were  themselves lost in
the distance, whhere the snowy  peaks rose grandly.  Here and
there  sseemed mighty  rifts in the mountains, through which,

as the sun began to sink,  we saw  now  and again  the white
gleam of ffalling water.  One of my companions touched my arm
ass we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty,
snow-covereed peak of a mountain,which seemed, as we wound on
ourr serpentine way, to be right before us.
     "Look! IIsten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed him-
self  reverently.
      As we wound on our endless way, and the sun  sank lower
and lower behinnd us, the  shadows  of the  evening  began to
creep rround us.  This was emphasized by  the fact  that  the
snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow
out with   a  delicate  cool  pink.  Here and there we passed
CCszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
that goitree was painfully prevalent.  By  the roadside  were
manny crosses, and as we swept by, my companions  all crossed
themselves. HHere and there was a peasant man or woman kneel-
ing   before a  shrine,  who  did  not  even turn round as we
approached, butt seemed in the  self-surrender of devotion to
have neeither eyes nor ears  for the outer world.  There were
many things new to me. For instance, hay-ricks in the trees,
and here  and there  very  beautiful masses of weeping birch,
ttheir white stems shining like  silver  through the delicate
green of thhe leaves.
     Noow  and  again  we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary
peasants's  cart--with  its long, snakelike vertebra, calcu-
lated  too suit  the  inequalities of the road.  On this were
ssure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants,  the
Cszeks withh their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured
sheeepskins, the  latter  carrying  lance-fashion  their long
staves, with  axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get
very  cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one
dark mistiness  the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine,
though  in the valleys which ran deep between  the  spurs  of
the hills, as we ascended through  the Pass, the  dark  firs
stood  ouut  here and  there  against the background of late-
llying snow.  Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine
woods that  seemed in the darkness  to  be  closing down upon
us,, great masses of greyness  which here and there bestrewed
the  trees,   produced  a peculiarly weird and solemn effect,
whichh carried on the thoughts  and  grim fancies  engendered
earlier  in  thhe evening, when the falling sunset threw into
strangee relief  the  ghost-like  clouds  which  amongst  the
Carpathians  seem  to  wind ceaselessly through the valleys.
Sometimess the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's
hhaste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down
and walk upp them, as we do at home, but the driver would not
heaar of it.  "No, no," he said. "You must not walk here. The
dogs are too  fierce."   And then he added, with what he evi-
dentlly  meant  for  grim  pleasantry--for he looked round to
catch the  apprroving  smile  of  the rest--"And you may have
enough   of such  matters before you go to sleep."   The only
stop he would make was a moment's pause to light his lamps.
     When  it grew dark there seemed  to be  some  excitement
ammongst the passengers,  and they kept speaking to him,  one
after the otther, as though urging him to  further speed.  He
lashhed the horses unmercifully with his long whip,  and with
wild  cries  oof  encouragement  urged  them  on  to  further
exertiions. Then through  the darkness I could see a sort  of
patch of grey liight ahead of us,as though there were a cleft
in the hhills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater.

The crazy coach rocked  on its  great leather  springs,  and
swayed likke a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on.
Thhe road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then
the mountainns seemed to come nearer  to  us on each side and
to ffrown down upon us.  We  were entering on the Borgo Pass.
One by one sevveral of the passengers offered me gifts, which
they ppressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no
denial.  These wwere certainly of an odd and varied kind, but
each wass given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and

a blessing,  and that  same  strange mixture of fear-meaning
movements   which I had seen outside the hotel at  Bistritz--
thhe sign of  the cross and  the  guard against the evil eye.
Then,  as wee flew  along,  the driver leaned forward, and on
eachh side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach,
peered eagerlly into the darkness.  It was evident that some-
thingg very  exciting  was  either happening or expected, but
though  I askedd  each  passenger, no  one  would give me the
slighteest explanation.  This state of excitement kept on for
some  little  time.  And  at last we saw  before us the Pass
opening   out on  the eastern side.  There were dark, rolling
cclouds overhead, and in  the air the heavy, oppressive sense
of thunder.. It seemed as though the mountain range had sepa-
ratted  two atmospheres,  and  that  now  we had got into the
thunderous onne. I was now myself looking out for the convey-
ance   which  was to  take  me  to  the Count.  Each moment I
expected to seee the glare of lamps through the blackness,but
all wass dark.  The only light was the flickering rays of our
own lamps,  in which  the steam from our  hard-driven horses
rose in aa white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying
wwhite before  us,  but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
The passenggers drew back  with  a sigh  of  gladness,  which
seeemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking
what I had beest do,  when  the driver, looking at his watch,
said  to the others something  which  I could hardly hear, it
was spoken so qquietly and in so low a tone, I thought it was
"An houur less than the time."   Then turning to me, he spoke
in German worse than my own.
      "There  is  no carriage here.  The Herr is not expected
after all. He wwill now come on to Bukovina, and return tomor-
row orr the next day, better the next day."   Whilst  he  was
speaking the horrses began  to  neigh  and  snort and  plunge
wildly,  so that the driver had to hold them up.Then, amongst

a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal cross-
ing of theemselves, a caleche, with four horses, drove up be-
hiind us, overtook us,  and drew up beside the coach. I could
see from thee flash of our lamps  as  the  rays fell on them,
thatt the horses  were coal-black and splendid animals.  They
were driven byy a  tall man,  with a long brown  beard  and a
great  black hat, which  seemed  to hide his face from us.  I
could only see tthe gleam of a pair of very bright eyes,which
seemed rred in the lamplight, as he turned to us.
     He  saiid  to the  driver,   "You  are early tonight, my
frieend."
     The  maan  stammered in reply,  "The English Herr was in
a huurry."
     To whiich the stranger replied, "That is why, I suppose,
youu wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive  me,
my friend. I  know too much, and my horses are swift."
     As he sspoke he smiled,and the lamplight fell on a hard-
lookking  mouth,  with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth,
as white as ivvory. One of my companions whispered to another
the liine from Burger's "Lenore".

"Denn n die Todten reiten Schnell."
("For tthe dead travel fast.")

     The    strange  driver evidently  heard the words, for he
loooked up with  a gleaming  smile.  The passenger turned his
face away, aat the same time putting out  his two fingers and
crosssing  himself.  "Give me the  Herr's luggage,"  said the
driver, and wiith exceeding alacrity my bags  were handed out
and puut in the caleche.  Then I descended from  the  side of
the coach, as thhe caleche  was close  alongside,  the driver
helping  me with a hand  which  caught my arm  in  a  grip of

steel. His strength must have been prodigious.
     WWithout a word he shook  his reins,  the horses turned,
and we swept intto the darkness of the pass. As I looked back
I saw thhe  steam from  the  horses of the coach by the light

of the lamps,and projected against it the figures of my late
companionss crossing themselves.  Then the driver cracked his
whhip  and called  to his horses, and off they swept on their
way to  Bukoovina.  As  they  sank into the darkness I felt a
straange chill, and a  lonely feeling  come  over  me.  But a
cloak  was  thhrown over  my  shoulders,  and a rug across my
knees,, and the driver said in excellent German--
     "The  night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count
baade me take all care of you.  There is a flask of slivovitz
(the plum brrandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you
shouuld require it."
      I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was
there all tthe same.  I  felt a  little  strangely, and not a
litttle  frightened. I think had there been any alternative I
should have ttaken it, instead  of  prosecuting  that unknown
nightt journey.  The  carriage went  at  a hard pace straight
along, then we   made a complete turn  and went along another
straighht  road.  It seemed  to  me that we were simply going
over and over the same  ground again, and so I took note  of
some saliient point, and found that this was so. I would have
lliked to have  asked the  driver what  this all meant, but I
really fearred to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was,
anyy  protest would have had no effect in case there had been
an intention  to delay.
     Byy-and-by,  however,  as I was curious to know how time
was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my
watch. Itt was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me
aa  sort  of  shock,  for  I suppose the general superstition
about midniight was increased  by  my recent  experiences.  I
waiited with a sick feeling of suspense.
     Then  a  doog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far
down thee  road,  a  long, agonized wailing, as if from fear.

The sound was taken up by another dog,  and then another and
another, ttill,  borne on the  wind which now  sighed  softly
thhrough the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come
from all oveer  the country,  as far as the imagination could
grassp it through the gloom of the night.
     At the firsst howl  the horses began to strain and rear,
but the  driver  spoke to  them  soothingly, and they quieted

down,  but  shivered  and sweated as  though after a runaway
from suddeen fright.  Then, far off in the distance, from the
moountains on  each side  of  us began a louder and a sharper
howling, thaat of wolves, which affected both the  horses and
myseelf in the same way.  For I was minded  to jump from  the
caleche and ruun, whilst they reared again and plunged madly,
so thaat the driver had to use all his great strength to keep
them  from  boltting.  In a few minutes, however, my own ears
got accuustomed  to  the sound, and  the horses so far became

quiet that the driver was  able to descend  and to stand be-
fore them..
     He petted aand soothed them,  and whispered something in
their eaars, as I have heard of  horse-tamers doing, and with

extraordinary effect,  for  under  his  caresses they became
quite manaageable  again,  though they  still  trembled.  The
drriver  again  took his seat, and shaking his reins, started
off at a greeat pace.  This time, after going to the far side
or tthe Pass,  he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which
ran sharply too the right.
      Soon  we  were  hemmed  in  with trees, which in places
arched  right oover the  roadway till we  passed as through a
tunnel..  And again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on
either side. Though we were in shelter, we  could  hear  the
rising wiind, for it moaned and whistled through  the  rocks,
aand the branches of the  trees crashed  together as we swept
along. It ggrew colder and colder  still, and  fine,  powdery
snoow began to fall,  so  that soon we and all around us were
covered with  a white blanket.  The keen  wind still  carried
the hhowling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went
on our way. Thee baying of the wolves sounded nearer and near-
er, ass though they were closing round on us from every side.
I grew dreadfullly afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The
driver,  however, was not in the least disturbed.He kept turn-
ing his head to left and right, but I could not see anything
through tthe darkness.
      Suddenly, away on our left I saw a fain flickering blue
flame.  The  ddriver saw  it  at the same moment.  He at once
checkeed the horses, and, jumping to the  ground, disappeared
into the darknesss.  I  did not  know what to do, the less as
the howlling of the wolves grew closer. But while I wondered,

the driver suddenly appeared  again, and without a word took
his seat,  and we resumed our journey.  I think  I  must have
faallen asleep  and kept  dreaming  of  the incident, for  it
seemed to bee repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is
likee a sort of awful nightmare.  Once the flame  appeared so
near the road,, that even in the darkness around us  I  could
watch  the driver's motions.  He went rapidly  to  where  the
blue flame arosee, it must have been very faint, for  it  did
not seemm to illumine the place around it at all, and gather-

ing a few stones, formed them into some device.
      Once  there appeared  a strange optical effect. When he
stood between mme and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I
could ssee its ghostly flicker all the same.This startled me,
but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes
deceived  me straining through the darkness.  Then for a time
tthere were no blue flames,  and we sped onwards  through the
gloom,  witth the  howling of the wolves around us, as though
theey were following in a moving circle.
     At last  thhere came a time when the driver went further
afield tthan he  had yet  gone,  and during  his absence, the

horses began to  tremble worse than ever  and  to snort  and
scream witth fright.I could not see any cause for it, for the
hoowling  of the  wolves had ceased altogether. But just then
the moon, saailing through the  black clouds, appeared behind
the  jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad  rock,  and by its
light I saw arround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and
lollinng red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.
They  were a huundred times more terrible in the grim silence
which hheld them  than  even when they howled.  For myself, I
felt a sort of paralysis of fear.It is only when a man feels
himself   face to  face with such  horrors that he can under-
sstand their true import.
     All att once the wolves began to howl as though the moon-
liight had had some peculiar effect on them.The horses jumped
about and reeared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that
rollled in a way painful to see.But the living ring of terror
encompassed thhem  on  every  side,  and they had perforce to
remainn within it.  I called to the coachman  to come, for it
seemed to me thaat our only chance was  to  try  to break out
through  the ring and to aid his approach, I shouted and beat

the side of the caleche, hoping by  the noise to  scare  the
wolves froom the side, so as to give him a chance of reaching
thhe  trap.  How he  came there,  I know not, but I heard his
voice raisedd  in  a tone of  imperious command,  and looking
towaards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept
his long arms,,  as  though  brushing  aside some  impalpable
obstaccle, the wolves fell back and back further still.  Just
then a heavy clooud passed across the face of  the  moon,  so
that we  were again in darkness.
     When II could see again the driver was climbing into the
calleche, and the wolves disappeared. This was all so strange
and  uncanny  that  a  dreadful  fear came upon me, and I was
afraiid to speak or move.  The time seemed interminable as we
swept on our waay, now in almost  complete darkness,  for the
rollingg clouds obscured the moon.
     We  kept on ascending,  with occasional periods of quick

descent, but in the main always ascending.Suddenly, I became
conscious  of the fact that the driver was in the act of pull-
iing  up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle,
from whose  tall black windows came no ray of light,and whose
brooken battlements showed a jagged line against the sky.


CHAPTER 2



            Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued


 
     5 May.--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had
been fully  awake  I must have noticed the approach of such a
remmarkable place.  In the gloom the courtyard looked of con-
siderable sizze,  and as  several dark ways led from it under
greatt round arches, it perhaps  seemed bigger than it really
is. I have not  yet been able to see it by daylight.
     When the caaleche  stopped, the driver  jumped  down and
held outt his hand to assist me to alight.  Again I could not

but notice his prodigious strength. His hand actually seemed
like a steeel vice that could have crushed  mine  if  he  had
chhosen. Then he took my traps, and placed them on the ground
beside me ass I stood close to a great door,  old and studded
withh large iron nails, and set in  a projecting  doorway  of
massive stone.. I could see even in  th e dim  light that the
stone  was massively carved,  but that  the carving  had been
much worn by timme and weather.  As I stood, the driver jump-
ed againn into his seat and shook the reins.The horses start-

ed forward,and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark
openings..
     I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what
to do.  OOf bell or  knocker there was no sign. Through these
ffrowning walls and dark  window  openings  it was not likely
that my voiice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed end-
lesss, and I felt doubts  and  fears crowding  upon me.  What
sort of placee had I come to,  and among what kind of people?
What  sort of grim adventure was it on  which I had embarked?
Was this a custtomary  incident  in the life of a solicitor's
clerk ssent out to explain the purchase  of  a  London estate
to a foreigner? Solicitor's clerk! Mina would not like that.
Solicitorr, for just before leaving London I got word that my
eexamination was successful, and I am now a full-blown solic-
itor! I beggan to rub my eyes and  pinch  myself  to see if I
werre awake. It all  seemed  like a horrible nightmare to me,
and I expecteed that I should suddenly awake, and find myself
at hoome, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as
I had now and aagain felt in the morning after a day of over-
work.   But my flesh answered the pinching test,  and my eyes
were not to be deceived.  I was indeed awake  and among  the
Carpathiaans.  All  I  could do now was to be patient, and to
wwait the coming of morning.
     Jusst as I had come  to  this conclusion I heard a heavy

step approaching behind the great door,  and saw through the
chinks thee  gleam  of  a  coming  light.  Then there was the
soound of rattling chains and  the clanking  of massive bolts
drawn back.   A key was turned with the loud grating noise of
longg disuse, and the great door swung back.
     Within,   stood a  tall old man, clean shaven save for a
long  white moustache, and  clad in  black from head to foot,
without  a  sinngle  speck of  colour  about him anywhere. He
held inn his hand an antique silver lamp,  in which the flame
burned without a chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long
quiveringg shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open
ddoor. The old man motioned me in with his  right hand with a
courtly gessture,  saying in excellent  English,  but  with a
strrange intonation.

     "Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own free
will!"   HHe made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood
liike a statue,as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him
into stone.TThe instant, however, that I had stepped over the
threeshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his
hand grasped   mine  with  a strength which made me wince, an
effectt  which  was not lessened  by  the fact that it seemed
cold as ice, morre like the hand of a dead than a living man.
Again hee said.
     "Welccome to my house! Enter freely.Go safely, and leave
soomething of the happiness you bring!"   The strength of the
handshake waas so much  akin  to  that which I had noticed in
the  driver,  whose  face I had not seen, that for a moment I
doubted  if itt were not the same person to whom I was speak-
ing.   So to make sure, I said interrogatively,  "Count Drac-
ula?"
     He b bowed in a courtly was as he replied, "I am Dracula,
aand I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in, the
night air iis chill, and you must need to eat and rest."As he
wass speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall,  and
stepping out,, took my luggage. He had carried it in before I
couldd forestall him. I protested, but he insisted.
     "NNay, sir, you are my guest. It is late,  and my people
are not available. Let me see to your comfort myself."He in-
sisted onn carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a
ggreat winding stair,  and along another  great  passage,  on
whose stonee floor our steps rang heavily. At the end of this
he  threw open a heavy door,  and I  rejoiced to see within a
well-lit roomm in which a table was spread for supper, and on
whosee mighty hearth a great fire of logs,freshly replenished,
flamed and flaared.
     The Couunt halted, putting down my bags, closed the door,
andd crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a
small  octagoonal  room lit  by a single  lamp, and seemingly
withoout a window of any sort. Passing through this, he open-
ed another doorr, and motioned me to enter.  It was a welcome
sight.   For here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed
with another log fire, also added to but lately, for the top
logs weree fresh,  which sent a hollow roar up the wide chim-
nney.  The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew,
saying, beffore he closed the door.
     "You wwill need, after your journey, to refresh yourself
by  making your toilet. I trust you will find all you wish.
When you are reeady, come into the other room, where you will
find yoour supper prepared."
     The lightt  and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome
seemedd to have dissipated  all my  doubts and fears.  Having
then reached my  normal state, I discovered that I  was  half
famishedd with hunger. So making a hasty toilet,  I went into

the other room.
      I found supper already laid out.  My host, who stood on
one side off the great fireplace,  leaning against the stone-
worrk,  made a graceful  wave of his  hand to the table,  and
said,
     " "I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will
I trust,  excusee me that I do not join you, but I have dined
already,, and I do not sup."
     I handed tto him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had
entrustted  to me.  He  opened  it and read it gravely. Then,
with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read. One pass-
age of itt, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure.
     "I musst regret that an attack of gout,  from which mal-
adyy I am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travel-
ling on my paart for some time to come. But I am happy to say
I cann send a sufficient substitute, one in whom I have every
possible confiddence.  He is a young man,  full of energy and
talent  in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition.
HHe is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my
service.  Hee shall be  ready to attend on you when you will
durinng his  stay,  and shall take  your instructions in all
matters."
       The  count himself came forward and took off the cover
of a dish,  and  I  fell to  at  once on  an excellent roast
chicken.  This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of
olld tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper.During
the time  I   was eating it the Count asked me many question
as  too  my  journey, and  I  told  him by degrees all I had
experienced.
      By this time I had finished my supper,and by my host's
desire had draawn up a chair by the fire and  begun to smoke
a cigarr which he offered me, at the same time excusing him-

self that he  did  not  smoke.  I had now an opportunity of
observing hhim, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.
      His face  was a strong,  a very strong, aquiline, with
high bridge of tthe thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils,
with loffty domed forehead,  and hair growing scantily round
tthe temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very
massive, almmost meeting over  the nose, and with bushy hair
that   seemed  to  curl  in its own profusion. The mouth, so
far as I could ssee it under the heavy moustache,  was fixed
and ratheer cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth.
TThese protruded over the lips, whose  remarkable  ruddiness
showed astonnishing vitality in a man of his years.  For the
rest,, his ears were pale, and at the tops  extremely point-
ed.  The  chin wwas broad and strong,  and  the cheeks  firm
though  tthin.  The general  effect was one of extraordinary
paallor.
     Hitherrto  I had noticed the backs of his hands as they
lay  on  his  knees  in  the firelight, and  they had seemed
rather white annd fine. But seeing them now close to  me,  I
could noot but notice that they were rather  coarse,  broad,
wwith squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the
centre of thhe palm.  The  nails were long and fine, and cut
to a  sharp point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands
touched me, I coould not repress a shudder. It may have been
that his  breath was rank,  but a horrible feeling of nausea
caame over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal.
     The Countt,  evidently noticing it, drew back. And with
a grim  sort  of smile,  which  showed  more than he had yet

done his protruberant teeth,  sat himself down again on his
own side off the fireplace. We were both silent for a while,
and  as  I  looked  towards the  window  I saw the first dim
streak of the ccoming dawn. There seemed a strange stillness
over eveerything. But as I listened, I heard as if from down
bbelow in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's
eyes gleamedd, and he said.
      "Listen to them, the children of the night. What music
they make!"   Seeing, I  suppose, some expression in my face
strangge to him, he added,"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city
cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter." Then he rose
and said..
     "But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and
tomorrow yyou shall sleep as late as you will.  I have to be
awaay till the afternoon,  so sleep well  and  dream  well!"
With a courteoous bow, he opened for me himself  the door to
the octtagonal room, and I entered my bedroom.
     I am all  in a sea of wonders. I doubt. I fear. I think
strangee  things,  which  I dare not confess to my own soul.

God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!

     7 May.--I-It  is again  early morning, but I have rested
and enjjoyed the last  twenty-four hours.  I slept till late

in the day, and awoke of my own accord.  When I had dressed
myself I weent into the room where we had supped,  and found
a coold breakfast laid out,  with coffee kept hot by the pot
being placed onn the hearth.  There was a card on the table,
on whichh was written--
      "I have to be absent  for a while.  Do not wait for me.
D."  I set tto  and enjoyed a hearty meal.  When  I had done,
I loooked for a bell,  so that I might let the  servants know
I had finishedd,  but I  could  not find one.  There are cer-
tainlyy odd deficiencies in  the  house,  considering the ex-
traordinary eviddences of wealth  which  are  round  me.  The
table seervice is of gold, and  so  beautifully wrought  that

it must be of immense value.   The curtains  and  upholstery
of the chaairs and sofas  and the hangings of my  bed  are of
thhe  costliest and  most  beautiful fabrics,  and must  have
been  of  faabulous value when they were made,  for  they are
centturies old, though  in excellent order.  I saw  something
like them in HHampton  Court,  but  they were worn and frayed
and mooth-eaten.  But still in none  of  the rooms is there a
mirror.  There   is  not even a toilet glass on my table, and
I had too get the  little shaving  glass from my bag before I

could either shave or brush my hair.  I  have not yet seen a
servant annywhere,  or heard a sound near  the castle  except
thhe howling of wolves.  Some time  after I had  finished  my
meal, I do nnot know whether to call it breakfast  of dinner,
for  it was between five  and six  o'clock when  I  had it, I
looked about ffor something to  read,   for I did not like to
go aboout the castle until I had  asked the  Count's permiss-
ion. There was aabsolutely nothing in the room,  book,  news-
paper, oor even writing materials,  so I  opened another door

in the room and found a sort of library.  The  door opposite
mine I triied, but found locked.
     In the   library  I  found,  to my great delight, a vast
numbeer of  English books,  whole  shelves  full of them, and
bound volumes oof magazines and  newspapers.  A  table in the
center  was littered with  English magazines and  newspapers,
though none of them were of  very  recent  date.  The  books
were of tthe most varied kind, history, geography,  politics,
ppolitical economy, botany,  geology,  law,  all  relating to
England andd  English  life  and  customs and manners.  There
werre even  such  books of reference as the London Directory,
the "Red"  annd  "Blue"  books,  Whitaker's Almanac, the Army
and NNavy Lists, and  it  somehow  gladdened  my heart to see
it, the Law Lisst.
     Whilst I   was  looking  at  the books, the door opened,
and thhe Count entered.  He saluted me  in  a hearty way, and
hoped that I hadd had a good night's rest. Then he went on.
     "I amm glad you  found your way in  here,  for I am sure
thhere is much  that will  interest you.  These  companions,"
and he laid  his hand on some of the  books,  "have been good
frieends to me, and  for  some  years past,  ever since I had
the idea of gooing to London, have given me many,  many hours
of pleeasure.  Through  them I  have  come to know your great
England,  and too  know her  is  to love  her.  I  long to go
through  the crowded  streets of your  mighty London,  to  be

in the midst of the  whirl  and rush of  humanity,  to share
its life,  its change, its  death, and all that makes it what
itt is.  But  alas!   As  yet I only know your tongue through
books. To yoou, my friend, I look that I know it to speak."
     ""But,  Count,"  I  said,  "You  know  and speak English
thoroughly!"  Hee bowed gravely.
      "I thank you, my friend,  for  your all  too-flattering
estimate, bbut yet I fear that I am but a little  way  on the
roaad I would travel. True,I know the grammar and the  words,
but yet I knoow not how to speak them.
      "Inddeed," I said, "You speak excellently."
      "Not so,," he answered. "Well, I  know that, did I move
and sppeak in your London, none  there are who would not know
me for a strangeer. That is not enough for me. Here I am nob-
le.I am  a Boyar. The common people know me, and I am master.

But  a stranger in  a  strange land, he is no one.  Men know
him not, aand to know  not  is to care not for.  I am content
iff I am like the rest, so  that  no man stops if he sees me,
or pauses inn his speaking if he  hears  my  words,  `Ha, ha!
A  sstranger!'  I have  been  so long  master that I would be
master  still,,  or at least that none other should be master
of me..  You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
Hawkins,  of Exeeter,  to  tell me all about my new estate in
London.   You shall, I trust,  rest  here with me a while, so

that by our talking I may learn the English intonation.  And
I would thhat you tell me when  I make  error,  even  of  the
smmallest, in my speaking.  I am sorry that  I had to be away
so long todaay, but you will,  I  know forgive one who has so
manyy important affairs in hand."
    Off  course I said all I could  about  being willing, and
asked if I mightt come into that room when I  chose.  He ans-
wered, ""Yes, certainly," and added.
     "YYou  may  go anywhere you  wish  in the castle, except
where the doors are  locked,  where  of course  you will not
wish to ggo. There is reason that all things are as they are,
aand did you  see  with  my eyes  and know with my knowledge,
you would pperhaps better understand."   I said I was sure of
thiis, and then he went on.
     "We arre in  Transylvania,  and Transylvania is not Eng-
lannd.  Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you
many  strangee  things.  Nay,  from  what you have told me of
your   experiences  already,  you   know  something  of  what
strange things  there may be."
      This led to  much  conversation,  and as it was evident
that he wantted to talk,  if  only for talking's sake, I ask-
ed hhim many  questions regarding  things  that  had  already
happened  to mme  or  come  within  my notice.  Sometimes  he
sheereed  off  the  subject,  or  turned  the conversation by
pretending  not  to understand,  but  generally  he  answered
all  I   asked most frankly.  Then as time went on, and I had

got somewhat  bolder,  I  asked  him  of some of the strange
things of  the preceding  night,  as  for  instance,  why the
cooachman went to the places  where  he  had  seen  the  blue
flames.  He   then  explained  to  me  that  it  was commonly
beliieved that on a certain night of  the  year, last  night,
in fact, when  all evil spirits  are  supposed  to  have  un-
checkeed sway, a  blue  flame  is seen over  any place  where
treasure has beeen concealed.
      "That treasure has been hidden,"  he  went  on, "in the
region throughh which you came last night, there can  be  but
littlee doubt. For it was the ground fought over  for centur-
ies by the Wallaachian, the Saxon, and the Turk.   Why, there
is hardlly a foot of soil in all this  region  that  has  not

been  enriched  by  the  blood of men, patriots or invaders.
In  the olld days there were  stirring times,  when the Aust-
riian and the Hungarian came up in  hordes, and the  patriots
went out to  meet them, men and women, the aged and the chil-
drenn too,  and  waited their  coming on  the rocks above the
passes,  that   they  might  sweep  destruction  on them with
their  artificial  avalanches.  When  the  invader was trium-
phant he found bbut little, for whatever  there  was had been
sheltereed in  the friendly soil."
     "Butt how,"  said I, "can it  have  remained so long un-
ddiscovered, when there is a  sure  index  to  it if men will
but take thhe trouble to look?  "The Count smiled, and as his
lipps ran back over his gums,  the  long, sharp, canine teeth
showed out sttrangely. He answered.
     "Becausee your peasant is at  heart a coward and a fool!
Thosee flames only  appear on one night, and on that night no
man of this lannd will, if he can help  it,  stir without his
doors.  And,dear sir, even if he  did  he would not know what
to do. Why, even the peasant that  you tell me of who marked
the placee  of the flame would not know where to look in day-
llight even for his own work.   Even you would not, I dare be
sworn, be aable to find these places again?"
      "There you are right," I said. "I know no more than the
dead where   even  to look for them."   Then we drifted  into
otheer matters.
     ""Come,"  he said at last, "tell me of London and of the
house which you  have procured for me."   With an apology for
my remisssness, I went  into my  own  room to  get the papers

from my bag.  Whilst I  was  placing them in order I heard a
rattling   of china  and  silver  in  the next room, and as I
paassed through, noticed that the table  had been cleared and
the lamp  liit,  for  it was by this time deep into the dark.
The  lamps  were also lit  in  the  study  or library,  and I
found the Counnt lying on the sofa, reading,  of  all  things
in thee world, and English Bradshaw's Guide.   When I came in
he cleared the bbooks and papers  from  the  table,  and with
him I weent into plans  and  deeds and  figures of all sorts.

He  was  interested  in  everything,  and  asked me a myriad
questions  about the place and its surroundings.   He clearly
haad studied  beforehand all he could get  on  the subject of
the neighborrhood,  for  he  evidently  at the end knew  very
muchh more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered.

     "Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?
When I go   there I shall  be all alone, and my friend Harker
Joonathan, nay, pardon me.  I fall into my country's habit of
putting yourr patronymic  first,  my  friend  Jonathan Harker
willl  not be by my side to correct and aid me.  He  will  be
in  Exeter,  mmiles away, probably working  at papers of  the
law wiith my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!"
     We  wentt thoroughly into the business  of  the purchase
of thhe estate at  Purfleet.  When I had  told  him the facts
and  got  his   signature to the  necessary  papers,  and had
writtenn a letter with them ready to post  to Mr. Hawkins, he
began to ask me how I had come  across  so suitable a place.
I  read tto him the  notes  which I had made at the time, and
wwhich I inscribe here.
     "At Purffleet,  on  a by-road, I came across just such a
placee  as  seemed to be  required, and where was displayed a
dilapidated nottice that the place was for sale.  It was sur-
roundedd by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy
stones, and has not  been  repaired for  a large  number  of
years.    The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all
eeaten with rust.
      "The  estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of
the old Quaatre Face, as the house is  four  sided,  agreeing
witth the cardinal points of the compass.  It contains in all
some twenty aacres, quite surrounded  by the solid stone wall
abovee mentioned.  There are many trees on it,  which make it
in places  glooomy,  and there is  a  deep, dark-looking pond
or smalll lake, evidently  fed  by some springs, as the water
is clear and flows away in  a fair-sized  stream.  The house
is very llarge and of  all periods  back, I  should  say,  to
mmediaeval  times, for one part  is of stone immensely thick,
with only aa few  windows high  up  and  heavily  barred with
iroon.  It looks like part of a keep, and is close to  an old
chapel or chuurch.  I  could  not enter it,  as I had not the
key oof the  door leading to it from  the house,  but I  have
taken with my   Kodak views of it  from various  points.  The
house hhad been added to,  but in a very straggling  way, and
I  can only guess at the amount  of  ground it covers, which
must  be   very  great.  There  are  but  few houses close at
hhand, one  being a  very large  house  only  recently  added
to and formmed into a private lunatic asylum. It is not, how-
eveer, visible from the grounds."
      When I had finished, he said, "I am glad that it is old
and big.  I mysself am of an old family, and to live in a new
house wwould kill  me.  A house cannot be made habitable in a
day, and after all, how few days go to make up a century.  I
rejoice aalso that there is a chapel of old times.  We  Tran-
ssylvanian  nobles love not to think that our  bones may  lie
amongst thee  common dead.  I seek  not gaiety nor mirth, not
thee  bright voluptuousness  of  much  sunshine and sparkling
waters which  please  the  young  and  gay.  I  am  no longer
youngg, and  my  heart, through weary years of mourning  over
the dead, is  aattuned to mirth.  Moreover, the walls  of  my
castle   are broken.  The shadows  are  many,  and  the  wind
breathes  cold through the broken battlements and casements.
I love thhe  shade  and  the shadow,  and would be alone with
mmy thoughts when  I  may."  Somehow his  words and  his look
did  not  sseem  to accord, or else  it was that  his cast of
facce made his smile look malignant and saturnine.
     PPresently,  with  an excuse,  he left me,  asking me to
pull my papers ttogether.  He was some little time away,  and
I began  to look at some of the  books around me.  One was an

atlas,  which  I  found opened naturally to England,  as  if
that map hhad  been much used.  On looking at it  I found  in
ceertain places little rings marked,  and on examining  these
I noticed thhat one was near London on  the  east side, mani-
festtly where his new  estate  was  situated.  The  other two
were Exeter, aand  Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.

     It was the better  part of an  hour when  the Count re-
turned.  ""Aha!"  he said.  "Still at your books?  Good!  But
yoou must not  work  always.  Come!  I am  informed that your
supper is reeady."  He took my arm, and we went into the next
roomm, where I found  an excellent supper ready on the table.
The  Count  aggain  excused  himself,  as he had dined out on
his beeing away  from  home.  But he sat as  on  the previous
night,  and chattted whilst I ate.  After  supper  I  smoked,
as on thhe last evening, and the  Count stayed with me, chat-

ting  and  asking  questions on every  conceivable  subject,
hour afterr hour.  I felt that it was getting  very late  in-
deeed,  but  I  did  not  say  anything,  for  I  felt  under
obligation tto  meet my  host's wishes  in every way.  I  was
not  sleepy, as  the long  sleep  yesterday had fortified me,
but I could noot help experiencing  that  chill  which  comes
over oone at the coming of the dawn,  which is  like, in  its
way, the turn  oof  the  tide.  They say  that people who are
near deaath  die  generally  at the  change to dawn or at the

turn of the tide.  Anyone who has  when  tired, and  tied as
it  were   to  his  post,   experienced  this  change in  the
attmosphere can well believe  it.   All at  once we heard the
crow of the   cock  coming  up with preternatural  shrillness
throough the clear morning air.
     Couunt  Dracula,  jumping to his feet, said,  "Why there

is the morning again!  How remiss I am to let you stay up so
long. You  must make your  conversation regarding my dear new
coountry  of England less interesting, so that I may not for-
get  how  tiime  flies  by  us,"   and with a courtly bow, he
quicckly left me.
      I went into  my  room and drew the curtains,  but there
was little to   notice.  My window opened into the courtyard,
all I  could see was the warm  grey  of quickening sky.  So I
pulled the curtaains again, and have written of this day.

     8 Mayay.--I  began to fear as I wrote in this book that I
waas getting too diffuse.  But now I am glad that I went into
detail  fromm  the  first,  for there is something so strange
abouut this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy.
I wish I weree safe out of it,  or that I had never come.  It
may bbe that this strange night existence is  telling on  me,
but would that  that were all!  If  there  were  any  one  to
talk too I could bear it, but there is no one.I have only the
Count to speak with, and he--  I  fear  I am myself the only
living sooul within the place.   Let me be prosaiac so far as
ffacts can be.  It will help me to bear  up,  and imagination
must not ruun riot with me. If it does I am lost.  Let me say
at  once how I stand, or seem to.
      I only slept a few hours when I went to bed,and feeling
that I could noot sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shav-
ing glaass by the window,  and was  just  beginning to shave.
Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count's
voice sayying to me, "Good morning." I started, for it amazed
mme that I had not seen him,since the reflection of the glass
covered thee whole room behind me.  In starting I had cut my-
sellf slightly, but did not notice it at  the moment.  Having
answered the  Count's salutation, I turned to the glass again
to seee how I had been mistaken.  This time there could be no
error,  for thee man  was  close to  me,  and I could see him
over myy shoulder.  But there was no reflection of him in the
mirror!   The whole room  behind me was displayed, but there
was no siign of a man in it, except myself.
      This  was  startling,  and coming on the top of so many
strange thiings, was beginning to increase that vague feeling
of  uneasiness  which  I always  have when the Count is near.
But at the innstant I saw the the cut had bled a little,  and
the bblood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor,
turning as I diid so half  round to  look for  some  sticking
plasterr.  When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a
sort of demoniac  fury, and  he  suddenly made  a grab at my
throat.   I  drew  away  and  his hand touched the string  of
bbeads which held the crucifix.  It  made  an  instant change
in him, forr the fury passed so quickly that I  could  hardly
bellieve that it was ever there.
     ""Take care," he said,  "take care how you cut yourself.
It is more dangeerous that you think in this  country."  Then
seizing  the  shaving glass,  he  went  on,  "And this is the

wretched thing  that  has  done  the mischief.  It is a foul
bauble  off  man's  vanity.  Away with it!"  And opening  the
wiindow with one  wrench  of his  terrible hand, he flung out
the glass, wwhich was shattered  into  a  thousand  pieces on
the  stones of the  courtyard  far below.  Then  he  withdrew
without a wordd.  It is very annoying,  for  I do not see how
I  am   to  shave,  unless  in my watch-case or the bottom of
the shaving pot,, which is fortunately of metal.
      When  I  went into  the dining room, breakfast was pre-
pared, but I  could not find the Count anywhere.  So I break-
fasteed alone.  It is strange that as yet I have not seen the
Count eat or drrink.  He  must be a very peculiar man!  After
breakfaast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out
on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South.
     The viiew was magnificent,  and from where I stood there
wass every opportunity of  seeing it.  The  castle is  on the
very edge of  a terrific precipice.  A stone falling from the
windoow would fall a thousand feet without touching anything!
As far as the eeye can reach is a sea of green tree tops,with
occasioonally a deep rift where there is a  chasm.  Here  and
there  are  silver  threads  where  the  rivers wind in deep
gorges thhrough the forests.
     But I am noot in heart to describe beauty,for when I had
seen thee view I explored further. Doors, doors, doors every-

where, and all locked and bolted.  In no place save from the
windows inn the castle walls is there an available exit.  The
caastle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!




CHAPTER 3

            Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued

     When n I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feel-
inng came over me.  I  rushed  up and down the stairs, trying
every door aand peering out of every window I could find, but
afteer a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered
all other feellings.  When  I  look  back after a few hours I
think  I must have been mad for the time,  for I behaved much
as a rat does inn a trap. When, however,  the  conviction had
come to  me that I was helpless I sat down quietly, as quiet-

ly as I have ever done  anything in  my  life,  and began to
think overr  what was  best to  be done. I am thinking still,
annd as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of one thing
only am I ceertain.  That  it is no use making my ideas known
to tthe Count.  He knows well that I am imprisoned, and as he
has done it hiimself,  and  has doubtless his own motives for
it, hee would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the
facts.  So far aas I can see, my only plan will be to keep my
knowledgge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open.  I am, I

know, either being deceived, like a baby,  by my own  fears,
or else I  am in desperate straits,  and if the latter be so,
I  need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.
      I had hardly come to  this  conclusion when I heard the
great door  below shut, and knew that the Count had returned.
He  did  not come at  once into the  library,  so I went cau-
tiously to myy own room  and found him  making the bed.  This
was oodd,  but only confirmed what I had  all  along thought,
that there are  no servants in  the house.  When  later I saw
him thrrough the chink of the hinges  of  the door laying the
table in the dining room,  I  was assured  of it.  For if he
does himsself all these  menial offices,  surely  it is proof
tthat there is no one else  in the castle,  it must have been
the Count   himself  who  was  the  driver of  the coach that
broought me here.  This  is a terrible  thought,  for if  so,
what does it   mean that he could control  the wolves,  as he
did,  by only holding  up his hand for  silence?   How was it
that all the peeople at  Bistritz  and on  the coach had some
terriblle fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix,
of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash?
     Bless that  good, good woman who hung the crucifix round
my neck!! For it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I

touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to
regard witth disfavour and as idolatrous should  in a time of
looneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is some-
thing in thee essence of the thing itself,  or that  it is  a
mediium,  a tangible help,  in conveying memories of sympathy
and comfort?    Some time, if it  may be, I must examine this
matterr and try to make up my mind about it.  In the meantime
I must find out  all I can about Count Dracula,as it may help
me to unnderstand.  Tonight he may talk of himself, if I turn

the conversation that way.  I must be very careful, however,
not to awaake his suspicion.

     Midnight.---I  have  had  a  long talk with the Count. I
asked   him  a  few questions on Transylvania history, and he
warmed up to the  subject  wonderfully.  In  his speaking of
things annd people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if
hhe had been present at them all.This he afterwards explained
by saying tthat to a Boyar the pride of his house and name is
hiss own pride,that their glory is his glory, that their fate
is his fate.   Whenever he spoke of  his house he always said
"we",,  and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking.
I wish  I  coulld put down all he said exactly as he said it,
for to  me it  was most fascinating.  It seemed to have in it
a whole history of the country. He grew excited as he spoke,
and walkeed about the room pulling his  great white moustache
aand grasping anything on which he laid  his  hands as though
he would crrush it by main strength.  One thing he said which
I sshall put down as nearly as I can, for it tells in its way
the story of  his race.
     "WWe Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins
flows the blood  of  many brave races who fought as the lion
fights,   for  lordship.  Here,  in the whirlpool of European
rraces, the Ugric tribe bore down  from Iceland  the fighting
spirit whicch Thor and Wodin game them,which their Berserkers
dissplayed  to  such  fell intent on the seaboards of Europe,
aye, and of AAsia  and Africa  too,  till the peoples thought
that  the werewolves  themselves had come.  Here,  too,  when
they came,  theey  found  the  Huns,  whose  warlike fury had
swept tthe earth like a living flame, till the  dying peoples
held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches,
who, expeelled from Scythia had mated with the  devils in the
ddesert.  Fools, fools!  What devil or what witch was ever so
great as Atttila,  whose blood is in these veins?" He held up
hiss arms.  "Is  it  a wonder that we were a conquering race,
that we were  proud,  that  when the Magyar, the Lombard, the
Avar,, the Bulgar, or the  Turk  poured  his thousands on our
frontiers, we ddrove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad
and  hiis  legions  swept through the Hungarian fatherland he
found us here when he reached the frontier, that the Honfog-
lalas wass completed there?And when the Hungarian flood swept
eeastward,the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victor-
ious Magyarrs, and to us for centuries was trusted the guard-
ingg of the frontier of Turkeyland.  Aye, and more than that,
endless duty  of the frontier guard, for  as  the  Turks say,
`wateer sleeps, and the enemy is sleepless.'  Who more gladly
than  we  throuughout  the Four Nations  received the `bloody
sword,'' or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the stand-
ard of the King?  When  was  redeemed that great shame of my
nation, tthe shame of Cassova,  when the flags of the Wallach
aand the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent?Who was it but
one of  my   own  race  who as Voivode crossed the Danube and
beaat the Turk on his own ground?  This was a Dracula indeed!
Woe was it thhat his own unworthy brother,when he had fallen,
sold  his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery
on them!  Was iit not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that
other oof his race who in a later age again and again brought
his forces over the great river into Turkeyland,who, when he
was beateen back, came again, and again,though he had to come
aalone  from  the  bloody  field where  his troops were being
slaughteredd, since  he  knew  that he alone could ultimately
triiumph! They said that he thought only of himself.Bah! What
good are peassants without a leader? Where ends the war with-
out aa brain and heart to conduct it?  Again, when, after the
battle of Mohaccs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the
Draculaa  blood  were amongst  their leaders,  for our spirit
would not brook that  we  were not free.  Ah, young sir, the
Szekelys,,  and  the  Dracula  as  their heart's blood, their
bbrains, and their swords,  can boast  a record that mushroom
growths likke the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach.
Thhe warlike days are over.  Blood is too precious a thing in
these days   of  dishonourable  peace, and the glories of the
greaat races are as a tale that is told."
     It was  by  this  time close on morning,  and we went to
bed.  (MMem., this diary seems horribly like the beginning of

the  "Arabian Nights,"  for  everything  has to break off at
cockcrow,  or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.)

     12 May.y.--Let me  begin  with facts, bare, meager facts,
veriified by books and figures,  and of which there can be no
doubt.  I mustt not confuse them with  experiences which will
have tto  rest  on  my own observation, or my memory of them.
Last evening wheen the Count  came  from his room he began by
asking   me  questions on  legal  matters and on the doing of

certain kinds of business. I had  spent the day wearily over
books, andd, simply to keep my mind occupied,  went over some
off the matters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn.There
was a certaiin  method in the Count's inquiries,  so  I shall
try  to put them down in sequence.  The knowledge may somehow
or some time bbe useful to me.
      First, he asked if a  man in England might have two so-
licitors orr more.  I  told him  he  might have a dozen if he
wisshed, but that it would not be wise  to have more than one
solicitor enggaged in one transaction, as  only one could act
at a  time, and that to change would  be  certain to militate
against his intterest.  He  seemed  thoroughly to understand,
and wennt on to ask if there would be any practical difficul-
ty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another
to look aafter shipping,  in case local help were needed in a
pplace far from the home of  the  banking solicitor.  I asked
to explain  more fully, so that I might  not  by  any  chance
misslead him, so he said,
     "I shalll illustrate.  Your  friend and mine,  Mr. Peter
Hawkiins, from under the shadow  of your  beautiful cathedral
at Exeter, whicch is far from  London,  buys  for  me through
your goood self my place  at  London.  Good!  Now here let me
say frankly,  lest  you should  think it strange that I have
sought thhe services of one so far off from London instead of
ssome one resident there,  that my motive was  that no  local
interest miight be served save my wish  only, and  as  one of
Lonndon residence might, perhaps,have some purpose of himself
or friend to  serve, I went  thus afield  to seek  my  agent,
whosee labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose I,
who have much oof affairs, wish to ship  goods,  say, to New-
castle,, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover,might it not be that
it  could  with  more  ease  be done by consigning to one in
these porrts?"
     I  answwered  that certainly  it would be most easy, but
thatt we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other,
so that local  work could be done locally on instruction from
any soolicitor, so that the  client,  simply  placing himself
in the hands of  one man,  could  have his wishes carried out
by him wwithout further trouble.
     "But,"" said he,"I could be at liberty to direct myself.
Is  it not so?"
      "Of course, " I replied, and "Such is often done by men
of business,whoo do not like the whole of their affairs to be
known bby any one person."
     "Good!" he  said,and then went on to ask about the means
of makinng consignments and the forms to be gone through, and

of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by fore-
thought  ccould  be  guarded  against.  I explained all these
thhings to him to the best of my  ability,  and  he certainly
left  me  unnder  the  impression  that  he would have made a
wondderful solicitor, for there  was nothing that he did  not
think of or fooresee. For a man who was never in the country,
and whho did not evidently do much in the way of business,his
knowledge and accumen were wonderful.  When  he had satisfied
himself  on these points of which he had  spoken,  and  I had

verified all as well as I could by  the  books available, he
suddenly sstood up and  said,  "Have you written  since  your
fiirst  letter  to  our friend Mr. Peter  Hawkins,  or to any
other?"
       It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered
that I had noot,  that  as yet I had not seen any opportunity
of seending letters to anybody.
     "Theen  write  now,  my young friend," he said, laying a
hheavy hand on my shoulder,  "write to  our friend and to any
other, and  say,  if it will please you, that  you shall stay
witth me until a month from now."
      "Do you wish me to stay so long?" I asked, for my heart
grew cold at thhe thought.
     ""I desire it much, nay I will take no refusal.When your
master, employerr, what you will, engaged that someone should
come on  his behalf,it was understood that my needs only were

to be consulted. I have not stinted. Is it not so?"
      What could I do but bow acceptance?  It was Mr.Hawkins'
interest, nnot mine, and I had to think of  him,  not myself,
andd  besides,  while  Count  Dracula was speaking, there was
that in his eeyes and in  his bearing which  made me remember
that  I was a prisoner, and that if  I wished it I could have
no choice. The  Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mas-
tery inn the trouble of my face,  for he began at once to use
them, but in his own smooth, resistless way.
     "II  pray  you,  my good young friend, that you will not
discourse of things other than business in your letters.  It
will doubbtless please your friends to know that you are well,

and that you look forward to getting home to them. Is it not
so?" As hee spoke he handed  me  three  sheets of  note paper
annd three envelopes.  They were all  of the thinnest foreign
post, and loooking at them,  then  at  him,  and noticing his
quieet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red
underlip,  I   understood  as well as if he had spoken that I
shouldd be more careful what I wrote, for he would be able to
read it. So I deetermined to write only formal notes now, but
to writee fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also  to  Mina,

for to her I could write shorthand,  which would  puzzle the
Count, if  he did see it. When I had written my two letters I
saat quiet, reading a book  whilst the  Count  wrote  several
notes, referrring as he wrote them to some books on his table.
Theen he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put
by his writinng materials, after which,  the instant the door
had cclosed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the lett-
ers, which weree face down on the table.I felt no compunction
in doinng so for under the circumstances I felt that I should
protect myself in every way I could.
     One of thee letters was directed to Samuel F.Billington,
No. 7,  The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna.
The third was to Coutts & Co.,  London,  and  the  fourth to
Herren  KKlopstock  &  Billreuth,  bankers,  Buda Pesth.  The
ssecond and fourth were unsealed. I was just about to look at
them when II saw the door handle move.I sank back in my seat,
havving just had time to resume  my  book before  the  Count,
holding stilll another letter in his hand, entered  the room.
He  ttook up the letters on the table and stamped  them care-
fully, and thenn turning to me, said,
     "I  trusst  you will forgive me, but I have much work to
do inn private this evening. You will,I hope, find all things
as you  wish."   At the  door he turned, and after a moment's
pause ssaid,  "Let me advise you,  my dear young friend. Nay,
let me warn you with all seriousness,  that should you leave
these roooms you will not by  any  chance  go to sleep in any
oother part of the castle. It is old,  and has many memories,
and  there  are bad dreams for those  who sleep unwisely.  Be
warrned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to
do,  then  haaste  to your own chamber or to these rooms, for
your  rest will  then be  safe.  But if you be not careful in
this respect, tthen,"  He  finished  his speech in a gruesome
way, foor  he motioned with  his  hands as if he were washing
them.  I quite understood.  My  only doubt was as to whether
any dreamm could be more terrible than the unnatural,horrible
nnet of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me.

     Later.----I endorse the last words written, but this time
theree  is no doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in
any place  wherre  he is not. I have placed the crucifix over
the heaad of my bed,I imagine that my rest is thus freer from
dreams, and there it shall remain.
     When he left me I went to my room.After a little while,
not heariing any sound,I came out and went up the stone stair
tto where I could look out towards the South.  There was some
sense of frreedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it
wass to me,as compared with the narrow darkness of the court-
yard.  Lookinng out on this, I felt that I was indeed in pri-
son,  and I seemed to want a breath of fresh  air,  though it
were of the nigght. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal ex-
istencee  tell on me. It is destroying my nerve.  I  start at
my  own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imagin-
ings. Godd knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in
tthis accursed place!I looked out over the beautiful expanse,
bathed in ssoft yellow moonlight  till it was almost as light
as  day.  In the soft light  the distant hills became melted,
and the shadoows in the  valleys and gorges of velvety black-
ness..  The mere beauty seemed  to cheer me.  There was peace
and comfort in  every breath I drew.As I leaned from the win-
dow my  eye was caught by something moving a storey below me,
and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
the roomss,  that  the  windows of the Count's own room would
llook out.  The  window at  which  I stood was tall and deep,
stone-mulliioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete.
Butt  it  was  evidently  many  a day since the case had been
there.I drew  back behind the stonework, and looked carefully
out..
     What  I  saw was the Count's  head  coming out from the
window. II did not see the face,  but  I  knew the man by the
nneck and the movement of his  back  and arms.  In any case I
could not mmistake the hands which I had had some many oppor-
tunnities of studying. I was at first interested and somewhat
amused, for iit is wonderful how small a matter will interest
and aamuse a man when he is a prisoner.  But my very feelings
changed to repuulsion and  terror  when I saw  the whole  man
slowly   emerge  from the window and  begin to crawl down the
castle wall over the dreadful abyss,face down with his cloak
spreadingg out around him like great wings.  At first I could
nnot believe my eyes.I thought it was some trick of the moon-
light, somee weird effect of shadow,  but I kept looking, and
it  could be no delusion.I saw the fingers and toes grasp the
corners of thhe stones,worn clear of the mortar by the stress
of yeears,  and by thus using every projection and inequality
move  downwardss  with  considerable speed,  just as a lizard
moves aalong a wall.
      What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature,
is it in the ssemblance of man? I feel the dread of this hor-
rible  place overpowering me.I am in fear, in awful fear, and
there is  no  esscape  for  me.  I  am encompassed about with
terrors  that I dare not think of.

     1515 May.--Once more I have  seen the count go out in his
lizard fashion.  He moved downwards in a sidelong  way, some
hundred ffeet down, and a good deal to the left.  He vanished
iinto some hole or window.  When his head had disappeared,  I
leaned out  to try and see more, but without avail.  The dis-
tannce was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I knew
he had left tthe castle now, and thought to use the opportun-
ity tto explore more than I had dared  to do as yet.  I  went
back to the  rooom,  and taking a lamp,  tried all the doors.
They weere all locked, as I had expected,  and the locks were
comparatively new.  But I went down the  stone stairs to the
hall wherre  I  had entered originally.  I found I could pull
bback the  bolts  easily  enough and unhook the great chains.
But the dooor was locked, and the key was gone! That key must
be  in the Count's room.  I must watch should his door be un-
locked, so thhat I may get  it and escape.  I went on to make
a thoorough examination of the  various  stairs and passages,
and to try the   doors  that opened  from them.  One  or  two
small rrooms near  the hall were  open, but there was nothing
to see in them  except  old  furniture,  dusty  with age and
moth-eateen. At last, however, I found one door at the top of
tthe  stairway  which, though it seemed locked, gave a little
under presssure. I tried it harder, and found that it was not
reaally locked,  but  that  the resistance came from the fact
that the hingges had fallen somewhat,and the heavy door rest-
ed onn the floor.  Here  was an opportunity which I might not
have again, so  I exerted myself,and with many efforts forced
it  bacck  so  that I could enter. I was now in a wing of the
castle  further  to  the  right than  the rooms I knew and a
storey loower  down.  From the  windows I  could see that the
ssuite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle,the win-
dows of thee end room looking out both west and south. On the
lattter  side,  as  well  as to the former, there was a great
precipice.  TThe  castle was built  on  the corner of a great
rock,, so that  on  three sides it was quite impregnable, and
great windows wwere placed here where sling, or bow, or culv-
erin coould  not  reach,  and consequently light and comfort,
impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secu-
red.  To   the  west was a great valley, and then, rising far
aaway, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak,
the sheer rrock studded  with  mountain ash  and thorn, whose
rooots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone.
This was eviidently the portion of the castle occupied by the
ladiies in  bygone days, for the furniture had more an air of
comfort than aany I had seen.
      The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight,
flooding  inn  through the  diamond panes, enabled one to see
evenn colours,whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay
over  all  andd disguised in some measure the ravages of time
and mooth.My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brill-
iant moonlight,  but I was glad to have it with me, for there
was a  ddread  loneliness in the place which chilled my heart

and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living
alone  in   the  rooms which I had come to hate from the pre-
seence of the Count,  and  after trying a little to school my
nerves, I  ffound  a soft quietude  come over me.  Here I am,
sittting at a  little  oak  table where in old times possibly
some fair ladyy sat to pen,with much thought and many blushes,
her iill-spelt love letter, and writing in my diary in short-
hand all that hhas happened since I closed it last. It is the
nineteeenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, un-
less my senses  deceive me, the old centuries had, and have,
powers off their own which mere "modernity" cannot kill.

       Later:  The morning of 16 May.--God preserve my sanity,
for to this I  am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety
are thhings of the past.  Whilst  I live on here there is but
one thing to hoppe for, that I may not go mad,  if, indeed, I
be not mmad already.If I be sane, then surely it is maddening

to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hate-
ful place  the Count is the least dreadful to me, that to him
allone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst
I can serve  his purpose. Great God!  Merciful God, let me be
calmm, for out of  that way  lies madness indeed.  I begin to
get new lightss on certain things which have puzzled  me.  Up
to noww I never quite knew what  Shakespeare  meant  when  he
made Hamlet say,,  "My tablets! Quick, my tablets!  `tis meet
that I pput it down," etc., For now, feeling as though my own

brain were unhinged or as if the shock  had come  which must
end in itss undoing, I turn to my diary for repose. The habit
off entering accurately must help to soothe me.
     Thee  Count's  mysterious  warning  frightened me at the

time.  It  frightens  me more not when I think of it, for in
the futuree he has  a fearful  hold  upon me. I shall fear to
dooubt what he may say!
     When I haad written  in my diary and had fortunately re-
placedd  the  book  and pen  in my  pocket I felt sleepy. The
Count's warning   came  into my mind,  but I took pleasure in
disobeyiing it. The sense of sleep was upon  me,  and with it

the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moon-
light sootthed, and the wide expanse without gave  a sense of
frreedom which refreshed me. I determined not to  return  to-
night  to thhe gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where,
of oold, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst
their  gentle  breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the
midst  of  remorseless wars.  I drew a great couch out of its
place near the ccorner, so that as I lay, I could look at the
lovely vview to east and south,and unthinking of and uncaring

for the  dust,  composed  myself for sleep. I suppose I must
have falleen asleep. I hope so, but I fear, for all that fol-
loowed was startlingly real, so real that now sitting here in
the broad,   full  sunlight  of the  morning, I cannot in the
leasst believe that it was all sleep.
      I was not alone.The room was the same, unchanged in any
way since I  came into it.I could see along the floor, in the
brillliant moonlight,my own footsteps marked where I had dis-
turbed the lonng accumulation of dust. In the moonlight  opp-
osite  me  were  three young women, ladies by their dress and
manner. I thoughht at the time that I must be dreaming when I
saw themm, they threw no shadow on the floor. They came close

to me,  and  looked at me for some time,  and then whispered
together.   Two were dark,  and had high aquiline noses, like
thhe Count, and great dark, piercing eyes,  that seemed to be
almost red wwhen  contrasted with  the pale yellow moon.  The
otheer was fair,as fair as can be, with great masses of gold-
en  hair and   eyes like  pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to
know hher face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy
fear,  but I couuld not recollect at the moment how or where.
All  thrree had brilliant  white teeth that shone like pearls

against  the ruby of their voluptuous lips.  There was some-
thing abouut them that made me uneasy,some longing and at the
saame time some deadly fear.I felt in my heart a wicked,burn-
ing desire tthat they would kiss me with those red lips.It is
not   good to  note  this down,  lest some day it should meet
Mina's  eyes aand  cause her pain, but it is the truth.  They
whispeered together,  and then they all three laughed, such a
silvery,musical  laugh, but as hard as though the sound never
could  hhave come through the softness of human lips.  It was

like the intolerable,tingling sweetness of waterglasses when
played on  by a cunning hand.  The  fair girl  shook her head
cooquettishly, and the other two urged her on.
     One   said,  "Go on! You are first, and we shall follow.
YYours' is the right to begin."
      The other added,  "He  is young and strong.  There  are
kisses for us aall."
     I lay qquiet,  looking out from under my eyelashes in an
agonny of delightful anticipation. The fair girl advanced and
bent  over  mee  till I could feel the movement of her breath
upon mme. Sweet it was in one sense,honey-sweet, and sent the
same tingling thhrough the nerves as  her  voice,  but with a
bitter uunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness,  as one

smells in blood.

     I was afraid to raise my eyelids,but looked out and saw
perfectly  under the lashes.  The girl went on her knees, and
beent over me, simply gloating.There was a deliberate volupt-
uousness whiich was both thrilling and repulsive,  and as she
archhed her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal,
till  I  couldd see in  the moonlight the moisture shining on
the sccarlet  lips  and on  the  red  tongue as it lapped the
white sharp teetth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips
went  beelow the  range  of  my  mouth and chin and seemed to

fasten on my throat.  Then she paused,  and I could hear the
churning ssound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips,
aand I could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of
my throat   began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand
thaat is to tickle it approaches nearer, nearer. I could feel
the soft, shiivering touch of the lips on the super sensitive
skin   of  my  throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth,
just touching aand  pausing there.  I closed my eyes in lang-
uorous  ecstasy and waited, waited with beating heart.
     BBut at that instant, another sensation swept through me
as quick as lighhtning.I was conscious of the presence of the
Count, aand of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury.  As

my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the
slender neeck of the fair woman and with giant's  power  draw
itt back,  the blue  eyes  transformed with fury,  the  white
teeth  champping  with  rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red
withh passion.  But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath
and fury,  eveen to the demons of the pit. His eyes were pos-
itivelly blazing.  The red light in them was lurid, as if the
flames of hell ffire blazed behind them. His face was deathly
pale,  aand the lines of it were  hard like drawn wires.  The

thick eyebrows that  met  over  the nose now  seemed like  a
heaving baar  of white-hot metal.  With a fierce sweep of his
arrm, he hurled the woman from him,  and then motioned to the
others, as tthough he were beating them back. It was the same
impeerious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves.  In  a
voice which,thhough low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut
througgh the air and then ring in the room he said,
     "Hoow dare you touch him, any of you?  How dare you cast

eyes on him when I had forbidden it?   Back, I tell you all!
This man bbelongs to me!  Beware how you meddle with him,  or
yoou'll have to deal with me."
     Thhe fair girl,  with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned
to answer him. "You yourself never loved.You never love!" On
this the  other women joined,and such a mirthless,hard, soul-
lless laughter rang through the room that it almost  made  me
faint to heear. It seemed like the pleasure of fiends.
     Then  the Count turned, after looking at my face  atten-
tiively, and said in a soft whisper, "Yes, I too can love.You
yourselves ccan tell it from the past. Is it not so? Well,now
I  ppromise you that when  I  am done with him you shall kiss
him at your wiill.Now go! Go! I must awaken him, for there is
work tto be done."
      "Are we to have nothing tonight?"said one of them, with
a low laugh,  aas she pointed to  the bag which he had thrown
upon thhe  floor,  and  which moved as though there were some
living thing within it.  For answer he nodded his head.  One
of the woomen jumped forward and opened it.If my ears did not
ddeceive me there was  a  gasp  and a low wail,  as of a half
smothered cchild. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast
witth horror. But as I looked,they disappeared, and with them
the dreadful  bag.There was no door near them, and they could
not hhave passed me without my noticing.They simply seemed to
fade into the rrays of the moonlight and pass out through the
window,, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a
moment before they entirely faded away.
     Then thhe horror overcame me,and I sank down unconscious.



CHAPTER 4

             Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued

     I a awoke in my own bed.  If it be that I had not dreamt,

the Count  must  have  carried  me here.  I tried to satisfy
myself on  the subject, but  could  not  arrive  at  any  un-
quuestionable result.  To be sure, there were  certain  small
evidences, ssuch as that my clothes were folded  and laid  by
in   a  manner  which  was not my habit.  My  watch was still
unwound, and II am rigorously accustomed to  wind it the last
thing  before going to bed, and many such details.  But these
things are no prroof, for they may have  been  evidences that
my mind  was not as usual, and, for some cause or another,  I

had certainly been much upset.I must watch for proof. Of one
thing I amm glad.If it was that the Count carried me here and
unndressed me,  he must have been hurried in his task, for my
pockets are  intact.  I  am sure this diary would have been a
mysttery to him which he would not have brooked.He would have
taken or destrroyed it.  As I look round this room,  although
it hass been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of sanc-
tuary,  for nothhing  can  be more  dreadful than those awful
women, wwho were, who are, waiting to suck my blood.

     1818 May.--I have been down to look at that room again in
daylight, for I must know the truth. When I got to the door-
way at  tthe top of the stairs I found it closed. It had been
sso forcibly  driven  against the jamb that part of the wood-
work was spplintered.  I could see  that the bolt of the lock
hadd not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
I fear it wass no dream, and must act on this surmise.

     19 MaMay.--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count
assked  me  in the  sauvest tones to write three letters, one
saying that  my work here was nearly done,  and that I should
starrt for home within a few days,another that I was starting
on the next moorning from  the  time  of the letter,  and the
third  that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz.  I
would fain have  rebelled, but felt that in the present state
of thinggs it would be madness to  quarrel  openly  with  the

Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power.  And to refuse
would be tto excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger. He
knnows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I
be dangerouss to him.  My only chance is to prolong my oppor-
tuniities. Something may occur which will give ma a chance to
escape.  I saww in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
which  was  manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him.
He  explained  tto  me that posts were few and uncertain, and
that my  writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends.

And he assured me  with so much impressiveness that he would
countermannd  the  later letters, which would be held over at
Biistritz  until  due  time  in case chance would admit of my
prolonging   my  stay, that to  oppose him would have been to
creaate new suspicion.  I therefore pretended to fall in with
his  views,  aand  asked  him  what dates I should put on the
letterrs.
     He  calcuulated  a  minute,  and  then  said, "The first
shouldd be June 12,the second June 19,and the third June 29."
     I know now  the span of my life. God help me!


     28 May.--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of
being  abble to send word home. A band of Szgany have come to
tthe  castle,  and  are encamped in the courtyard.  These are
gipsies. I  have notes of them in my book.  They are peculiar
to  this part of the  world,  though allied to  the  ordinary
gipsies all   the world over.  There are thousands of them in
Hungaary  and  Transylvania,  who are almost outside all law.
They  attach thhemselves  as a  rule  to  some great noble or
boyar,  and call themselves by his  name.  They are  fearless
and without religion, save superstition, and they talk  only
their ownn varieties of the Romany tongue.
      I  shall  write some letters home, and shall try to get
them to havee  them  posted.  I  have  already spoken to them
throough my window to begin acquaintanceship. They took their
hats off and mmade obeisance and many signs, which however, I
could   not  understand  any  more  than I could their spoken
language . . .

     I have written the letters. Mina's is in shorthand, and
I simply   ask  Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I
haave explained my situation, but without the horrors which I
may only surrmise.  It  would shock and frighten her to death
weree  I  to  expose  my heart to her. Should the letters not
carry, then thhe  Count  shall  not yet know my secret or the
extentt of my knowledge . . .

     I havave given the letters. I threw them through the bars
off my window with a gold piece,  and made what signs I could
to have themm posted.  The  man who took them pressed them to
his  heart and bowed, and then  put them in his cap.  I could
do no more. I  stole back to the study, and began to read. As
the Coount did not come in, I have written here . . .

       The Count has come.  He sat down beside me, and said in
his smoothest  voice as  he opened two  letters,  "The Szgany
has giiven me these, of which,  though I know not whence they
come,  I shall,   of course,  take care.  See!"--He must have
looked aat it.--"One  is from  you,  and  to  my friend Peter

Hawkins.  The other,"--here  he  caught sight of the strange
symbols ass he opened the envelope,  and the  dark  look came
innto his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly,--"The other  is
a vile thingg, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It
is nnot signed. Well! So it cannot matter to us."And he calm-
ly held letterr and envelope in the  flame of  the lamp  till
they wwere consumed.
      Then he went on,  "The letter to Hawkins, that I shall,
of course sennd on, since it is yours.Your letters are sacred
to mee.  Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break
the seal.Will yyou not cover it again?"He held out the letter
to me,  and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope.

     I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.
When he weent out of the room I could hear the key turn soft-
lyy. A minute later I went over and  tried it, and  the  door
was locked..
     When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into
the room,, his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on
tthe sofa.He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner,
and seeingg that I had been sleeping, he said, "So, my friend,
yyou are tired?  Get to bed.  There is the surest rest. I may
not have thhe pleasure of talk tonight,  since there are many
labbours to me, but you will sleep, I pray."
     I passeed to my room and  went to  bed,  and, strange to
say,, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.
      31 May.--This  morning  when  I  woke I thought I would
provide mysself with some  papers  and  envelopes from my bag
andd keep them in my pocket, so that I might write in case  I
should  get   an  opportunity,  but again a surprise, again a
shockk!
     Every scraap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes,
my memmoranda,  relating to railways and travel, my letter of
credit,  in factt  all that might be useful to me were I once
outside  the castle. I sat and pondered awhile, and then some

thought occurred to me, and I made search of my  portmanteau
and in thee wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.
     The suiit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my
overrcoat and rug.  I could find no trace of  them  anywhere.
This looked liike some new scheme of villainy . . .

     17 June.-.--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of
my bedd cudgelling my brains,  I heard without a crackling of
whips and  poundding  and  scraping  of  horses'  feet up the
rocky paath beyond the courtyard.  With joy  I hurried to the

window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons,
each drawnn by eight sturdy horses,  and at  the head of each
paair a Slovak,  with his wide  hat, great nail-studded belt,
dirty sheepsskin, and high  boots.  They  had also their long
stavves in hand. I ran to the door, intending to  descend and
try and join tthem through the main hall,  as I  thought that
way miight be opened  for them.  Again a  shock,  my door was
fastened on the  outside.
     Theen I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked

up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the "hetman" of
the Szganyy came out, and seeing them pointing  to my window,
saaid something, at which they laughed.
     Henceforth  no effort of mine,no piteous cry or agonized
entreatyy, would make them even look at me.  They  resolutely

turned away. The leiter-wagons contained great,square boxes,
with handlles of thick rope.  These  were evidently  empty by
thhe ease with which the Slovaks handled  them,  and by their
resonance ass they were roughly moved.
     Whenn they  were all unloaded and packed in a great heap
iin one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money
by the Szgaany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each
to  his horse's head.  Shortly afterwards, I heard the crack-
ling of theirr whips die away in the distance.


     24 June.--Last night the Count left me early, and lock-
ed himselff into his own room.As soon as I dared I ran up the
wiinding stair,  and looked out of the window,  which  opened
South. I thoought I would watch for the Count, for  there  is
someething going on.The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the
castle and aree doing work of some kind.  I know it,  for now
and thhen, I hear a far-away muffled sound as of  mattock and
spade, and, whattever it is, it must be the end of some ruth-
less villlainy.
     I hadd  been at  the  window  somewhat less than half an
hoour, when I saw something coming out of the Count's window.
I drew back  and watched carefully,  and  saw  the  whole man
emerrge.  It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the
suit of clothees which I had worn whilst travelling here, and
slung  over his shoulder the terrible bag which  I  had  seen
the women take aaway. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
and in  my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of  evil,
that he will allow others to see me, as they think,  so that
he may booth leave evidence that I  have  been  seen  in  the
ttowns  or  villages  posting  my  own  letters, and that any
wickedness   which  he  may  do  shall by the local people be
atttributed to me.
      It makes  me  rage  to  think  that this can go on, and
whilst I am  shut up here, a veritable prisoner,  but without
thatt protection of the law which is even a criminal's  right
and consolatioon.
     I thoughtt I would watch for the Count's return, and for
a longg time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to not-
ice  that  theree were some quaint  little specks floating in
the rayss of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains

of dust,and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a
nebulous ssort of way.I watched them with a sense of soothing,
aand a sort of calm stole over me.I leaned back in the embra-
sure in  a   more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy
morre fully the aerial gambolling.
      Something  made  me start up, a low, piteous howling of
dogs somewheree far  below  in  the  valley, which was hidden
from   my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the
floating  moats   of dust to  take new shapes to the sound as
they  daanced  in the moonlight.  I felt myself struggling to

awake to  some  call of my instincts. Nay, my very  soul was
strugglingg, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striv-
inng to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised!
      Quicker and quicker danced the dust.The moonbeams seem-
ed  to  quiverr  as  they  went  by me into the mass of gloom
beyondd. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take
dim  phantom  shhapes. And then I started, broad awake and in
full  poossession  of my  senses,  and ran screaming from the

place.
     The pphantom shapes,  which were becoming gradually mat-
errialised from the moonbeams, were those three ghostly women
to whom I waas doomed.
     I  fled,  and  felt somewhat safer in my own room, where
there  was  no  moonlight,  and  where the  lamp was burning
brightly..
     When  a  coouple  of  hours had passed I heard something
stirringg in the Count's room,  something  like  a sharp wail

quickly suppressed.  And then there was silence, deep, awful
silence, wwhich chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried the
dooor, but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing. I
sat down andd simply cried.
      As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without,  the
agonised  crry of a woman. I rushed to the window, and throw-
ing  it up, peered between the bars.
      There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, hold-
ing her handss over her heart as one distressed with running.
She wwas leaning against the corner of the gateway.  When she
saw my face at  the  window she threw  herself  forward,  and
shoutedd in a voice laden with menace,  "Monster,  give me my
child!"
     Shee threw herself on her knees,and raising up her hands,
cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she
tore her  hair and beat her breast,  and abandoned herself to
aall the violences of extravagant emotion. Finally, she threw
herself forrward, and though I could not see her,I could hear
thee beating of her naked hands against the door.
     Soomewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard
the voice of the Count calling in his harsh,metallic whisper.
His calll seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howl-
ing of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a pack of them
poured, llike a pent-up dam when liberated,  through the wide
eentrance into the courtyard.
     Thhere was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the
wolves was but short. Before long they streamed away singly,
licking ttheir lips.
     II could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of
her child, and sshe was better dead.
     What shalll I do?  What can I do?  How can I escape from
this drreadful thing of night, gloom, and fear?

     25 Junune.--No  man  knows  till he has suffered from the
nigght how sweet and dear to his  heart  and  eye the morning
can be.  Whenn  the sun  grew so  high  this morning  that it
strucck the top of the  great gateway opposite my window, the
high spot whichh it touched seemed to me as if the dove from
the ark  had lighted  there.  My  fear fell from me as if it
hhad been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth.
     I must ttake action of some  sort whilst the courage of
the daay is upon me. Last night one of my post-dated letters
went to post, the first of that fatal  series  which  is to
blot out tthe very traces of my existence from the earth.
     LLet me not think of it. Action!
      It  has  always been at night-time that I have been mo-
lested or  thrreatened,  or in some way in danger or in fear.
I havee not yet seen the  Count  in the  daylight.  Can it be
that he sleeps wwhen others wake, that he may be awake whilst
they sleeep? If I could only get into his room!  But there is

no possible way.  The  door is always locked, no way for me.
     Yes,  there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his
boody has gone why may not another  body go?  I have seen him
myself crawll from his window.  Why should not I imitate him,
and  go in by his window?   The chances are desperate, but my
need is more ddesperate still.  I shall risk it. At the worst
it cann only be death, and a man's death is not a calf's, and
the dreaded Hereeafter may still be open to me.  God  help me
in my taask! Goodbye, Mina, if I fail. Goodbye,  my  faithful

friend and second father.Goodbye, all, and last of all Mina!

     Samame day, later.--I have made the effort, and God help-

ing me, have come safely back to this room.  I must put down
every detaail in order.  I went whilst my courage  was  fresh
sttraight to the window on the south side,  and  at  once got
outside on tthis side.The stones are big and roughly cut, and
the  mortar has by process of time been washed  away  between
them. I took ooff my boots, and ventured out on the desperate
way.   I looked down once, so as to make sure that  a  sudden
glimpse of the aawful depth would not overcome  me, but after
that keppt my eyes away from it.I know pretty well the direc-

tion and distance of the Count's window,  and made for it as
well as I  could,having regard to the opportunities available.
II did not feel dizzy, I suppose I was too  excited,  and the
time seemedd ridiculously short till I  found myself standing
on  the window sill and trying to raise up the sash.   I  was
filled with aagitation, however,  when I  bent down and  slid
feet  foremost in through the window.Then I looked around for
the Count, but  with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
The rooom was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things,
which seemed to have never been used.
     The furniiture was something  the  same style as that in
the soouth rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the
key, but it was  not in the lock, and I could not find it any-
where.   The only thing I found was a  great  heap of gold in
one corner, gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Aust-
rian,and  Hungarian,and Greek and Turkish money, covered with
aa  film  of  dust, as though it had lain long in the ground.
None  of itt that I noticed was less than three hundred years
oldd.There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but
all of them oold and stained.
      At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it,
for, since   I  could not find the key of the room or the key
of  the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I
must  make  ffurther  examination, or all my efforts would be
in vaain.  It was open,  and led through a stone passage to a
circular stairwway, which went steeply down.
     II  descended,  minding  carefully  where I went for the
stairs were darkk, being only lit  by  loopholes in the heavy
masonry..   At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like pass-

age,  through which came a deathly,  sickly odour, the odour
of old earrth newly turned.   As  I  went through the passage
thhe smell grew closer and heavier.   At  last  I pulled open
a heavy doorr which  stood  ajar,  and found myself in an old
ruinned chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard.
The roof was bbroken, and in two places were steps leading to
vaultss,  but the ground had recently been dug over,  and the
earth placed in  great wooden boxes,  manifestly  those which
had beenn brought by the Slovaks.
     Theree was nobody about,  and I made a search over every
innch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance.  I went down
even into thhe vaults, where the dim light struggled,although
to ddo so was a dread to my very soul.  Into  two  of these I
went, but saw  nothing except fragments of  old  coffins  and
piles  of dust.  In the third, however, I made a discovery.

     There,  in one of the great boxes,  of which there were
fifty in aall,  on  a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!
Hee was either dead or asleep.I could not say which, for eyes
were open annd stony, but without the glassiness of death,and
the  cheeks had the warmth of life through all  their pallor.
The lips were  as red as ever. But there was no sign of move-
ment,  no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart.
     I  bent over him,  and  tried  to find any sign of life,
but in vain.   He  could  not  have lain there long, for the
earthy smmell would have passed away in a few hours.   By the
sside of the box was its cover, pierced with  holes here  and
there.  I tthought he might have the keys on him,  but when I
wennt to search I saw the dead eyes,  and in them dead though
they were, suuch a look of hate,  though unconscious of me or
my prresence,  that  I fled from the  place,  and leaving the
Count's room byy the window, crawled again up the castle wall.
Regainning my room,  I  threw myself panting upon the bed and
tried to think..

     29 June.---Today  is the date of my last letter, and the
Count hhas taken steps to prove that it was genuine,for again
I saw him leave the castle  by the  same window,  and  in my
clothes.   As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished
II had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him.
But I fear  that no weapon  wrought along by man's hand would
havve any effect on him.  I dared not wait to see him return,
for I feared  to see those weird sisters.  I came back to the
libraary, and read there till I fell asleep.
     I was awaakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly
as a mman could look as he said,"Tomorrow, my friend, we must
part.  You returrn to your beautiful England,  I to some work
which maay have such an end that we may never meet.Your lett-

er home  has been despatched.  Tomorrow I shall not be here,
but all shhall be ready for your journey. In the morning come
thhe Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and al-
so  come  soome  Slovaks.  When  they  have gone, my carriage
shalll come for you,  and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to
meet the  diliigence from Bukovina to  Bistritz.  But I am in
hopes  that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula."
      I  suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
Sincerity!  Itt seems like a profanation of the word to write
it in  connection  with such a monster, so I asked him point-
blank, "Why may  I not go tonight?"
     "Because, ddear sir,  my coachman and horses are away on
a missioon."
     "But I wwould walk with pleasure.  I want to get away at
once.."
     He smiled,, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I
knew thhere  was some  trick behind his  smoothness.  He said,
"And your baggagge?"
     "I do noot care  about it.  I can send for it some other
time.."
     The  Countt  stood up,  and said,  with a sweet courtesy
which mmade me rub my eyes, it seemed so  real,  "You English
have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit  is
that whicch rules our boyars, `Welcome the coming,  speed the
pparting guest.'  Come with me, my dear young friend.  Not an
hour shall  you wait in my house against your will,though sad
am  I at your going,and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!"
With a stateely gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded  me down
the  stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he stopped.  "Hark!"
     Close at  hand came the howling of  many wolves.  It was
almostt as if the sound sprang up at the rising  of his hand,
just as the musiic of a great orchestra seems  to leap  under
the batoon of the conductor.  After a  pause of  a moment, he

proceeded, in his  stately way, to  the  door, drew back the
ponderous   bolts, unhooked  the  heavy  chains, and began to
drraw it open.
      To my  intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked.
Suspiciously,   I  looked  all round, but could see no key of
any kinnd.
     As  the   door began to open,  the howling of the wolves
withouut grew louder and angrier. Their red jaws, with champ-
ing teeth, and ttheir blunt-clawed  feet as they leaped, came
in throuugh the opening door.  I knew than that  to  struggle

at the moment against the Count was useless.With such allies
as these aat his command, I could do nothing.

     But  still  the door continued slowly to open, and only
the Count''s  body stood  in the gap.   Suddenly it struck me
thhat this might be the moment and means of my doom. I was to
be given to  the wolves, and at my own instigation. There was
a diiabolical wickedness in the idea  great  enough  for  the
Count, and as  the last chance I cried out, "Shut the door! I
shall  wait till morning."  And I  covered  my  face  with my
hands to hide myy tears of bitter disappointment.
      With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the
door  shut,   and the  great bolts clanged and echoed through
the  hall as they shot back into their places.
     In sillence we returned to the library, and after a min-
utee or two  I  went to my own room.  The last I saw of Count
Dracula was hhis kissing his hand to me, with  a red light of
triummph in  his eyes,  and  with a smile  that Judas in hell
might be proud  of.
     When I wwas in my room and about to lie down,I thought I
heardd a whispering at my door. I went to it softly and list-
ened.  Unless mmy ears deceived  me, I heard the voice of the
Count..
     "Back!   Back to your own place!   Your time is not yet
come. Waiit!  Have patience!  Tonight is mine. Tomorrow night
iis yours!"
     Thhere was a low,sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage
I threw open  the  door,  and saw without the three terrible
women liccking their lips.  As I appeared, they all joined in
aa horrible laugh, and ran away.
      I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It
is then so neaar the end?  Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Lord, help me,
and thhose to whom I am dear!

     30 JuJune.--These  may be  the last words I ever write in
thhis diary.  I  slept till  just before the dawn, and when I
woke threw mmyself on my knees,for I determined that if Death
camee he should find me ready.
     At   last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew
tthat the morning had come.  Then came the welcome cock-crow,
and I felt  that I was safe. With a glad heart,  I opened the
dooor and ran down  the  hall.  I  had seen that the door was
unlocked, andd now escape  was before  me.   With  hands that
trembbled with  eagerness, I  unhooked  the chains and  threw
back the massivve bolts.
     Butt  the  door  would  not  move.  Despair seized me. I

pulled and pulled at the door, and shook it till, massive as
it was, itt rattled in its casement.I could see the bolt shot.
IIt had been locked after I left the Count.
     Then aa wild desire took me to obtain  the  key  at  any
rissk,and I determined then and there to scale the wall again,
and gain  thhe Count's room.  He might kill me, but death now
seemmed the happier choice of evils. Without a pause I rushed
up to the eastt window, and scrambled down the wall,as before,
into   the Count's room.  It was empty, but that was as I ex-
pected. I couldd not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
remaineed. I went through the door in the corner and down the
winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel.I
knew now  well enough where to find the monster I sought.
      The great box was in the same place,  close against the
wall, but the llid was  laid on  it,  not  fastened down, but
with thhe nails ready in their places to be hammered home.
      I knew I  must  reach the body for the key, so I raised
the lid, andd laid it back against the wall.  And  then I saw
someething which filled my very soul with horror.  There  lay
the Count,but  looking as if his youth had been half restored.
For tthe white hair and moustache were changed  to dark iron-
grey.  The cheeeks were fuller, and  the  white  skin  seemed
ruby-reed underneath.  The mouth was redder than ever, for on
the lips were gouts of fresh blood,  which trickled from the
corners oof the mouth and  ran  down  over the chin and neck.
EEven the deep,burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh,
for the lidds and pouches underneath were bloated.  It seemed
as  if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood.
He lay like  a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.
     I  shuddered as I bent over to touch him,and every sense
in me revolted at the contact, but I had to search, or I was
lost.  Thhe coming night might see my own body a banquet in a
ssimilar war to those horrid three.  I felt all over the body,
but no siggn could I find of the key.Then I stopped and look-
edd at the Count.  There was a  mocking  smile on the bloated
face which sseemed to drive me mad.  This was the being I was
helpping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries
to come he  miight, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his
lust ffor blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of
semi-demons to bbatten on the helpless.
     The verry thought drove me mad.  A terrible desire  came
uponn me to rid the world of such  a monster.  There  was  no
lethal weapon  at hand, but I seized a shovel which the work-
men haad been using to fill the cases, and lifting  it  high,
struck, with thee edge downward, at the hateful face.  But as
I did soo the head turned, and the eyes fell upon me,with all

their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyze
me, and thhe shovel turned in my  hand  and  glanced from the
faace, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The sho-
vel fell froom my hand across the box,and as I pulled it away
the  flange of the blade caught  the  edge  of  the lid which
fell over agaiin, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The
last gglimpse I had was of the bloated face,blood-stained and
fixed with a griin of malice which would have held its own in
the nethhermost hell.
     I thought  and  thought what should be my next move, but
my brain seemeed on fire,and I waited with a despairing feel-
ing  ggrowing  over  me.  As I waited I heard in the distance
a gipsy song sunng by merry voices coming closer, and through
their soong the rolling  of  heavy wheels and the cracking of

whips.  The Szgany and the  Slovaks  of  whom  the Count had
spoken werre coming.  With a last look around and  at the box
whhich contained the vile body,  I ran  from  the  place  and
gained the CCount's room,determined to rush out at the moment
the  door should be opened.   With strained ears, I listened,
and heard  dowwnstairs  the grinding  of the key in the great
lock aand  the falling back of the heavy  door.   There  must
have been some oother  means of entry, or some one had a  key
for one  of the locked doors.
     Then  theere  came  the sound  of many feet tramping and
dying  away in some passage which sent  up a clanging echo. I
turned to run doown again towards the  vault,  where I  might
find thee new entrance,  but at the  moment there  seemed  to

come a violent  puff  of wind,  and the  door to the winding
stair bleww to with  a shock that set the dust from the lint-
ells flying.   When  I  ran to push  it open, I found that it
was  hopelesssly  fast.  I was again a  prisoner, and the net
of ddoom was closing round me more closely.
     As  I  wrrite  there is in the passage  below a sound of
many ttramping  feet and the crash of weights  being set down
heavily,  doubtlless the boxes, with their freight  of earth.
There waas a sound of hammering.  It is the box being  nailed

down.  Now  I can  hear the heavy feet tramping  again along
the hall,  with with many other idle feet coming behind them.
      The door is shut, the chains rattle.  There is a grind-
ing of the kkey in the lock.  I can hear the  key  withdrawn,
thenn another door opens and shuts.  I hear  the  creaking of
lock and bolt..
     Hark!   In   the  courtyard  and down  the rocky way the
roll of  heavy wheels, the crack of whips,  and the chorus of

the Szgany as they pass into the distance.
     I  amm  alone  in the castle with those  horrible women.
Faaugh! Mina is a woman, and there is nought in common.  They
are devils oof the Pit!
     II shall  not  remain  alone  with them.  I shall try to
scale the castlee wall farther than  I have yet attempted.  I
shall taake some of the gold with me, lest I want it later. I

may find a way from this dreadful place.
     And theen away for home! Away to the  quickest and near-
est  train! Away from the cursed spot, from this cursed land,
where the  devvil  and  his children still  walk with earthly
feet!!
     At least God's mercy  is better than that of those mon-
sters, annd the precipice is steep and high.   At its  foot a
mman may sleep, as a man.  Goodbye, all.  Mina!


CHACHAPTER 5

     LETETTER FROM MISS MINA MURRAY TO MISS LUCY WESTENRA

9 M May.

My dearest t Lucy,

     Forgrgive my long delay in writing,but I have been simply
ooverwhelmed with work.  The life of an assistant schoolmist-
ress is  soometimes trying.  I am longing to be with you, and
by  the sea,  where we can talk together freely and build our
castles in thhe  air.  I  have been working very hard lately,
becauuse  I  want  to keep up with Jonathan's studies,  and I
have been practticing shorthand very assiduously. When we are
marriedd I shall  be able  to be useful to Jonathan, and if I
can  stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to
say in  tthis way and write it out for him on the typewriter,
aat which also I am practicing very hard.
     He  and  I  sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he
is keeeping  a  stenographic  journal  of his travels abroad.
When I am with  you I shall keep a diary  in  the same way. I
don't mmean  one of those  two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-
squeezed-in-a-corner  diaries,  but  a sort of journal which
I can wriite in whenever I feel inclined.
      I  do  not  suppose there  will be  much of interest to
other people,, but it is not intended  for them.  I  may show
it too Jonathan  some day if there  is  in it anything  worth
sharing, but itt is really an exercise book.  I shall try  to
do whatt I see lady journalists do, interviewing and  writing
descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told
that, witth a little practice, one can remember all that goes
oon or that one hears said during a day.
     However,   we  shall  see.  I will tell you of my little
plans  when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from
Jonathan from Trransylvania.  He is well, and will be return-
ing in aabout a week.  I am longing to hear all his news.  It

must be nice to see strange  countries.  I wonder  if  we, I
mean Jonatthan and I, shall ever see them together.  There is

  LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY


      17, 7, Chatham Street
       Wednesday

M
My dearest Mina,


     I  must  say you  tax me very unfairly with being a bad
corresponndent.  I wrote  you twice since we parted, and your
llast letter was only your  second.  Besides,  I have nothing
to tell youu.  There is really nothing to interest you.
     Townn is very pleasant just now,  and we go a great deal
tto picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As
to the talll, curly-haired man, I suppose  it was the one who
wass  with  me  at  the last Pop.  Someone has evidently been
telling taless.
     That was   Mr. Holmwood.   He often comes to see us, and
he and  Mamma get on very well together,  they  have  so many
things to talk about in common.
      We met some time ago a man that  would just do for you,
if you were   not  already  engaged to  Jonathan.  He  is  an
exceellant parti, being handsome, well off, and of good birth.
He is  a  docctor and really clever.  Just fancy!  He is only
nine--and  twenty,  and  he has an immense lunatic asylum all
under his own ccare.  Mr. Holmwood introduced  him to me, and
he callled here to see us, and often comes  now.  I  think he
is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most
calm.  Hee seems absolutely imperturbable.  I can fancy  what
aa wonderful power he must have over his patients.   He has a
curious habbit of looking one straight  in  the  face, as  if
tryying to read one's thoughts.  He tries  this on very  much
with me,but II flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack.
I knnow that from my glass.
     Do you  ever try to read your own face?  I do, and I can
telll you it is not a bad study, and gives you  more  trouble
than you can wwell fancy if you have never tried it.
     He say thaat I afford him a curious psychological study,
and I hhumbly think I do.  I do not, as you know,  take suff-
icient interest  in dress to  be able  to describe  the  new
fashions..  Dress is a bore.  That is slang again,  but never
mmind.  Arthur says that every day.
      There, it is all out,Mina, we have told all our secrets
to each othher since we were children. We have slept together
andd eaten together, and laughed and cried together, and now,
though I havee spoken, I would like to speak more.  Oh, Mina,
coulddn't you guess?  I love him.  I am blushing  as I write,
for although I  think he loves me, he has  not  told me so in
words.   But, oh, Mina, I love him.  I love him!  There, that
does me good.
      I  wish  I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire un-
dressing,  aas we  used  to  sit, and I would try to tell you
whatt I feel.  I do not know  how  I  am writing this even to
you.  I am afrraid to stop, or I should  tear  up the letter,
and I  don't want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all.
Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you think
about it..  Mina, pray for my happiness.

    Lucy

     P.S.-.--I  need not tell you this is a secret.  Goodnight
aggain.  L.

 LETTETER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY

24 May

My dearesest Mina,

     ThThanks,  and  thanks, and  thanks  again for your sweet
letter.  It was so nice to be able to tell you and  to  have
your symppathy.
    My  deaar, it never rains but it pours.  How true the old
prooverbs are.  Here  am I, who shall be twenty in September,
and yet I nevver had a proposal  till today,  not a real pro-
posall, and today I had three.  Just fancy!  Three  proposals
in one day!  Issn't it awful!  I feel sorry, really and truly
sorry,  for two of the poor fellows.  Oh, Mina, I am so happy
that I don't know what to do with myself.  And three propos-
als!  Butt, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of  the girls,
oor they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas, and
imagining tthemselves injured and slighted  if in their  very
firrst day at home they did not get six at least.  Some girls
are so vain!   You and I, Mina dear, who are  engaged and are
goingg to settle down soon soberly  into  old married  women,
can despise vannity.  Well, I  must tell you about the three,
but youu must keep it a  secret, dear, from every one except,
of course, Jonathan.  You will tell him, because I would, if
I were inn your place, certainly tell Arthur.  A woman  ought
tto tell her husband everything.  Don't you think  so,  dear?
And I must  be fair.  Men like women, certainly  their wives,
to  be quite as fair as they are. And women, I am afraid, are
not always quuite as fair as they should be.
      Well,  my  dear,  number  One came just before lunch. I
told you of hiim, Dr. John  Seward, the  lunatic  asylum man,
with tthe strong jaw and the good forehead.  He was very cool
outwardly, but wwas nervous all the same.  He  had  evidently
been schhooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and

remembered them, but he almost managed to sit  down  on  his
silk hat,  which men don't generally do when  they  are cool,
annd then when he wanted to appear  at  ease  he kept playing
with a lanceet in a way that made me nearly scream.  He spoke
to mme, Mina, very straightfordwardly.  He told me how dear I
was to him, thhough he had known me so little,  and  what his
life wwould be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to
tell me how unhaappy he would be if  I  did not care for him,
but whenn he saw me cry he said he was a brute  and would not

add to my present trouble.  Then he broke off and asked if I
could lovee him in time, and when  I shook my  head his hands
trrembled,  and then  with  some  hesitation he asked me if I
cared alreaddy for any one else.He put it very nicely, saying
thatt he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but on-
ly to know, beecause if a woman's heart  was free a man might
have hhope.  And then, Mina, I felt  a  sort of  duty to tell
him that there wwas some one. I only told  him that much, and
then he  stood up, and he looked very  strong  and very grave

as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be
happy, andd that If I ever wanted  a  friend I must count him
onne of my best.
      Oh, Mina dear, I can't help crying, and you must excuse
this letter bbeing all blotted. Being proposed to is all very
nice  and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at all a happy
thing when you  have to see a poor fellow,whom you know loves
you honnestly, going away and looking all broken hearted, and
to know that, no matter what he may say  at  the moment, you
are passiing out of his life.  My dear,  I  must stop here at
ppresent, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.


Evening.

     A Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than
when I left off,, so I can go on telling you about the day.
     Well,, my dear, number Two came after lunch.  He is such
a  nice fellow,and American from Texas, and he looks so young
and so freshh  that  it  seems  almost impossible that he has
beenn to so many places and has such adventures. I sympathize
with poor Desddemona when she had such a stream poured in her
ear, eeven by  a black man.  I suppose that we women are such
cowards that we  think a  man will save us from fears, and we
marry hiim.  I know  now what  I would do if I were a man and

wanted to make  a girl  love me.  No, I don't, for there was
Mr.Morris  telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any,
annd yet . . .
      My dear,  I am somewhat previous.  Mr. Quincy P. Morris
found me alone..  It seems that a man always does find a girl
alone.   No,  he doesn't,  for  Arthur tried  twice to make a
chance, and I helping him all I could, I am not  ashamed  to
say it noow. I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris does-
nn't  always speak slang, that is to say, he never does so to
strangers oor before them, for he is really well educated and
hass exquisite manners, but he found out that it amused me to
hear him talkk American slang,and whenever I was present, and
theree was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I
am afraid, my ddear, he has to invent  it all,  for  it  fits
exactlyy into whatever else he has to say.  But this is a way
slang has. I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang.
I do not  know  if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him
uuse any as yet.
      Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy
and jolly ass he  could, but I could see all the same that he
was  very nervous.   He took my hand in his, and said ever so
sweetly . . ..
     "Miss Lucy,  I know I ain't good enough to regulate the
fixin's   of  your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till
yyou find a man that is you will go join them seven young wo-
men with  tthe lamps when  you quit.  Won't you just hitch up
aloong-side  of me and let us go down the long road together,
driving in doouble harness?"
      Well, he did look so hood humoured and so jolly that it
didn't  seemm  half so  hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr.
Sewaard.  So I said, as lightly  as  I  could, that I did not
know anything  of hitching, and that I wasn't broken to harn-
ess att all yet.   Then he said that he had spoken in a light
manner,  and he  hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing
so on soo grave, so  momentous, and occasion for him, I would

forgive him.   He really did look serious when he was saying
it, and I  couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he
waas number Two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could
say a  word   he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-
makiing, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked
so earnest oveer it that I shall never again think that a man
must   be  playful  always,  and never earnest, because he is
merry at times.   I suppose he saw something in my face which
checked  him, for he suddenly stopped,and said with a sort of

manly fervour that I could have loved  him for if I had been
free . . ..
     "Lucy, you  are an honest hearted girl, I know. I should
not be hhere speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe

you clean grit,right through to the very depths of your soul.
Tell me,   like  one good fellow to another, is there any one
eelse that you care for?   And if there is I'll never trouble
you a hair''s breadth again, but will be, if you will let me,
a vvery faithful friend."
     My dear  Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so
littlle worthy of them?  Here was I almost making fun of this
great  hearted,,  true  gentleman.   I burst into tears, I am
afraid,, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in
more ways than one, and I really felt very badly.
      Why can't they let a girl marry three men,or as many as
want her, annd save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and
I muust not say it.  I am glad to say that, though I was cry-
ing,  I was  aable to look into Mr. Morris' brave eyes, and I
told hhim out straight . . .
     "Yes,  tthere is some one I love, though he has not told
me yeet that he  even loves me."  I was right to speak to him
so frankly, forr quite a light came into his face, and he put
out botth  his  hands  and took mine, I think I put them into
his, and said in a hearty way . . .
     "That's my  brave girl. It's better worth being late for
a chancee  of  winning you  than  being in time for any other

girl in the world.  Don't cry, my dear.  If it's for me, I'm
a hard  nuut  to  crack,  and I take it standing up.  If that
otther  fellow doesn't  know his happiness, well, he'd better
look for it  soon, or he'll have to deal with me.Little girl,
yourr honesty  and  pluck  have  made me a friend, and that's
rarer than a llover, it's more selfish anyhow.   My dear, I'm
going  to  have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom
Come.Won't you ggive me one kiss?  It'll be something to keep
off the   darkness  now  and then.  You can, you know, if you

like, for that other good fellow, or you could not love him,
hasn't spooken yet."
     Thhat quite won me,  Mina, for it was brave and sweet of
him, and noble  too,  to a rival, wasn't it?  And he so sad,
so I leannt over and kissed him.
     He stoood up with my  two hands in his, and as he looked
downn into my face, I am afraid  I was blushing very much, he
said, "Little  girl, I hold  your hand, and you've kissed me,
and iff these things don't make us friends nothing ever will.
Thank you for yoour sweet honesty to me, and goodbye."
    He wrung myy  hand,  and taking up his hat, went straight
out of  the room without looking  back,  without  a tear or a
quiver or a pause, and I am crying like a baby.
      Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there
are lots of giirls about who would worship the very ground he
trod oon?  I know I would if I were free, only  I  don't want
to be free  My ddear,  this quite  upset  me,  and I  feel  I
cannot wwrite of happiness just at once, after telling you of

it,and I don't wish to tell of the number Three until it can
be all happpy.  Ever your loving . . .
  Lucyy

     P.S.--Oh,   about  number  Three,  I needn't tell you of
number  Three, need I?  Besides, it was all  so  confused. It
seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both
his arms  were round me, and he was kissing me.  I  am  very,
vvery happy, and I don't know what I have done to deserve it.
I must onlyy try in the future to show that I am not ungrate-
full to God for all His goodness to me in  sending to me such
a lover, suchh a husband, and such a friend.
        Goodbye.

     DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
  (Kept in phonoograph)

     25 5 May.--Ebb  tide in appetite today.  Cannot eat, can-

not rest,  so diary instead.  since my rebuff of yesterday I
have a sorrt of empty feeling.  Nothing in the world seems of
suufficient importance to be worth the doing.  As I knew that
the only curre for this sort of thing was work,I went amongst
the  patients.  I picked out one who has afforded  me a study
of much intereest.  He is so quaint that I  am  determined to
undersstand him as well as I can.Today I seemed to get nearer
than ever beforee to the heart of his mystery.
      I  questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with
a view to  makiing myself master of the facts of his halluci-
nation.. In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, some-
thing of cruelty.  I seemed to wish to keep him to the point
of his maadness, a thing which I avoid with the patients as I
wwould the mouth of hell.
     (Mem.,,  Under  what circumstances would I not avoid the
pitt of hell?)  Omnia Romae venalia sunt. Hell has its price!
If there be aanything  behind  this instinct it will be valu-
able   to  trace  it  afterwards  accurately, so I had better
commence  to doo so, therefore . . .
     R. M,  Reenfield,  age 59.   Sanguine temperament, great
physiccal strength, morbidly excitable, periods of gloom,end-
ing in some fixeed idea which I cannot make out.   I  presume
that thee sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing  in-

fluence end in a mentally-accomplished  finish,  a  possibly
dangerous  man, probably dangerous if unselfish.  In  selfish
meen caution is as secure an armour for  their  foes  as  for
themselves.   What I think of on this point is,  when self is
the  fixed point the centripetal force is  balanced with  the
centrifugal. WWhen duty, a cause,  etc., is the fixed  point,
the laatter force is paramount, and only accident of a series
of accidents cann balance it.

        25 May.


My dear Art,
       We've  told  yarns by the campfire in the prairies, and
dressed one  another's  wounds  after trying a landing at the
Marqquesas, and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca. There
are more yarnss to be told,and other wounds to be healed, and
anotheer health to be drunk.   Won't you  let  this  be at my
campfire tomorroow night? I have no hesitation in asking you,
as  I  kknow  a  certain  lady is engaged to a certain dinner

party, and that you are free.  There will only be one other,
our old paal at the Korea, Jack Seward. He's coming, too, and
wee both want to mingle our weeps  over the wine  cup, and to
drink a heallth with all our hearts to the  happiest  man  in
all  the wide world, who has won the noblest heart  that  God
has made and bbest worth winning.   We  promise  you a hearty
welcomme, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your
own right hand.   We shall both swear to leave you at home if
you drinnk too deep to a certain pair of eyes.  Come!
       YYours, as ever and always,

CHAPTERTER 6

                     MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL

       24 July. Whitby.--Lucy  met me  at the station, looking
sweeter and loovlier than ever, and we  drove up to the house
at thee Crescent in which they have rooms.  This is  a lovely
place.  The litttle river, the Esk, runs through a deep vall-
ey, whicch broadens out as it comes near the harbour. A great

viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view
seems someehow further away than it really is.  The valley is
beeautifully green, and it is so steep  that when  you are on
the high lannd on either side you look right across  it,  un-
lesss you are near enough to see down.  The houses of the old
town--the sidee away from us, are  all red-roofed,  and  seem
piled  up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see
of Nuremberg. Riight over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abb-
ey, whicch was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of

part of "Marmion," where the girl was built  up in the wall.
It is a moost noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beaut-
ifful and romantic bits.  There is a legend that a white lady
is seen in oone of the windows. Between it and the town there
is aanother church, the  parish one,  round  which  is  a big
graveyard, alll full of tombstones.  This  is  to my mind the
nicestt spot in Whitby, for it  lies right over the town, and
has a full view  of the  harbour and all  up the bay to where
the headdland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea.It

descends so steeply over  the  harbour that part of the bank
has fallenn away, and some of the graves have been destroyed.
      In one place part of the stonework of the graves stret-
ches out oveer the sandy pathway far below.  There are walks,
withh seats beside them, through the churchyard,  and  people
go and sit theere all day long looking  at the beautiful view
and ennjoying the breeze.
     I shall comme and sit here often myself and work.Indeed,
I am wriiting now, with my book on my knee, and listening  to

the talk of three old men who are sitting  beside  me.  They
seem to doo nothing all day but sit here and talk.
     The harbbour lies below me, with, on the far  side,  one
long  granite wall stretching out into the sea, with  a curve
outwards at thee end of it,in the middle of which is a light-
house.   A heavy seawall runs along  outside  of  it.  On the
near side, the seawall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and
its end ttoo has a  lighthouse.   Between the two piers there
iis a  narrow  opening  into the harbour, which then suddenly
widens.
       It is nice at high water, but when the tide is  out  it
shoals away  to nothing,and there is merely the stream of the
Esk,, running between banks  of  sand, with  rocks  here  and
there.  Outsidde the harbour on this side  there rises for a-
bout hhalf a mile  a  great  reef, the sharp  of  which  runs
straight out froom behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
it is a  buoy with a bell, which swings in  bad  weather, and

sends in a mournful sound on the wind.
     They  havve a legend here that when a ship is lost bells
are heeard out at sea.  I must ask the old man about this. He
is coming this wway . . .
     He  is a funny old man.  He must be awfully old, for his

face is gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree.He tells
me that hee is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor  in
thhe Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is,
I am afraid,, a very sceptical person, for when I  asked  him
abouut the bells at sea and the  White Lady at  the abbey  he
said very brussquely,
     "I woouldn't  fash masel' about them, miss.  Them things
bee all wore out.  Mind, I don't say that they never was, but
I do say thaat they wasn't in my time.  They be all very well
for  comers  and  trippers,  an' the like, but not for a nice
young lady likke you.  Them  feet-folks  from  York and Leeds
that bbe always eatin'cured herrin's  and  drinkin'  tea  an'
lookin' out to bbuy cheap  jet  would  creed aught.  I wonder
masel'   who'd  be  bothered  tellin' lies  to them, even the

newspapers, which is full of fool-talk."
     I thougght he would be a good person to  learn interest-
ing  things from, so I asked him if he  would mind telling me
something abouut the whale fishing in the  old  days.  He was
just ssettling himself to begin  when  the  clock struck six,
whereupon he labboured to get up, and said,
     "I   must  gang  ageeanwards home  now, miss.  My grand-

daughter doesn't  like  to  be  kept waitin' when the tea is
ready, forr it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees,  for
thhere be a many of `em, and miss, I lack belly-timber sairly
by the clockk."
     He hobbleed  away, and I could see him hurrying, as well
as he  could, down the  steps.  The steps are a great feature
on the place.  TThey  lead from the town to the church, there
are hunddreds of them,  I do not know how many, and they wind

up in a delicate curve.  The slope is so gentle that a horse
could easiily walk up and down them.
    I thiink  they  must  originally have had something to do
wwith the abbey.  I shall go home too.  Lucy went out, visit-
ing with heer mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did
nott go.

     1 Augugust.--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we
haad a  most  interesting talk with my old friend and the two
others who aalways come and join him. He is evidently the Sir
Oraccle of them,and I should think must have been in his time
a most dictatoorial person.
      He will not admit anything, and down faces everybody.If
he can't out-aargue them he bullies them,and then takes their
silencce for agreement with his views.
      Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock.
She has got  a beautiful colour since she has been here.
     I nooticed  that  the  old  men did not lose any time in
ccoming and sitting near her when we sat down.She is so sweet
with old peeople, I think they all fell in  love  with her on
thee spot.  Even my old  man succumbed and did not contradict
her, but gavee me double share instead. I got him on the sub-
ject  of the legends , and he went off at once into a sort of
sermon.  I mustt try to remember it and put it down.
     "It  be  alll fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel, that's
what it  be and nowt else.These bans an' wafts an' boh-ghosts

an' bar-guests an'  bogles an' all anent them is only fit to
set  bairnns  an'  dizzy women a'belderin'.  They be nowt but
aiir-blebs.  They, an'  all grims an'  signs an' warnin's, be
all  inventeed by parsons an' illsome berk-bodies an' railway
toutters to skeer an'  scunner hafflin's, an' to get folks to
do somethin' tthat  they don't other incline to.  It makes me
irefull to think o' them.  Why,  it's them  that, not content
with printin' liies  on  paper  an'  preachin'  them  ou t of
pulpits,, does want to be cuttin' them on the tombstones.Look

here all around you in what  airt ye will.  All them steans,
holdin' upp their  heads  as  well  as  they can out of their
prride, is acant, simply tumblin' down with the weight o' the
lies wrote oon them, `Here lies the body'  or  `Sacred to the
memoory' wrote on all of them, an' yet in nigh half  of  them
there bean't nno  bodies at  all,  an'  the  memories of them
bean'tt cared a pinch of snuff about, much less sacred.  Lies
all of them, notthin' but lies of one kind or another! My gog,
but it''ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when
they come tumblin' up in their death-sarks, all jouped toge-
ther an'  trying' to drag their tombsteans with them to prove
hhow good they was, some of them trimmlin' an' dithering,with
their handss that dozzened an' slippery from lyin' in the sea
thaat they can't even keep their gurp o' them."
     I coould  see  from  the old fellow's self-satisfied air
aand the way in which he looked round for the approval of his
cronies  thhat  he  was  "showing off," so I put in a word to
keeep him going.
      "Oh,  Mr. Swales,  you  can't be serious.  Surely these
tombstones aree not all wrong?"

     "Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin'
where theyy make out the people too good, for there  be  folk
thhat do think a balm-bowl be like the  sea,  if only  it  be
their own.   The whole thing be only lies. Now look you here.
You  come here a stranger, an' you see this kirkgarth."
      I nodded, for I thought it better to assent,  though  I
did  not  quuite understand his dialect.  I knew it had some-
thinng to do with the church.
     He weent on,  "And  you consate that all these steans be
abboon folk that be haped here,  snod  an' snog?"  I assented
again.   "Thhen  that  be  just where the lie comes in.  Why,
therre be scores of  these laybeds  that be toom as old Dun's
`baccabox on FFriday night."
      He nudged one of his  companions, and they all laughed.
"And, my  gogg!   How could they  be otherwise?  Look at that
one,  the aftest abaft the bier-bank, read it!"
     I wentt over and read, "Edward Spencelagh, master marin-
er,,murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854,
age 30."  Wheen I came back Mr. Swales went on,
      "Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murd-
ered off thhe coast of Andres!  An' you consated his body lay
undder!   Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the
Greenland  seeas above," he pointed northwards, "or where the
curraants may  have drifted them.  There be the steans around
ye.  Ye  can, wwith your young eyes,  read the small print of
the liees  from here.  This  Braithwaite  Lowery, I  knew his
father, lost  in  the Lively off Greenland in `20, or Andrew
Woodhousee, drowned in the same seas in 1777, or John Paxton,
ddrowned off Cape Farewell a year later,or old John Rawlings,
whose  granndfather  sailed  with me,  drowned in the Gulf of
Finnland in `50.  Do ye think that all these men will have to
make a  rush  to Whitby  when the  trumpet sounds?  I have me
antheerums aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they'd
be jommlin' andd jostlin' one another that way that it `ud be
like  aa  fight  up  on the ice in the old days, when we'd be
at one another from daylight to dark, an' tryin'  to tie  up
our cuts  by the aurora borealis."  This was evidently  local
ppleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies
joined in wwith gusto.
     ""But,"  I said,  "surely you are not quite correct, for
you start on thee  assumption  that  all  the poor people, or
their sppirits, will have to take their tombstones with  them

on the  Day  of  Judgment.  Do you think that will be really
necessary??"
     "Well,  whhat  else  be  they tombstones for?  Answer me
that, mmiss!"
     "To pllease their relatives, I suppose."
      "To please their relatives, you suppose!"  This he said
with intensse scorn. "How will it pleasure their relatives to
knoow that lies is wrote over them, and that everybody in the
place knows tthat they be lies?"
     He  pointedd to  a stone at our feet which had been laid
down as  a slab, on  which  the seat was rested, close to the

edge of the cliff.  "Read the lies on that thruff-stone," he
said.
       The letters were upside down to me from where I sat,but
Lucy was moree opposite to them, so she leant over and  read,
"Sacrred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope
of a glorious rresurrection, on July 29,1873,falling from the
rocks aat Kettleness.  This tomb was erected by his sorrowing
mother to her dearly beloved son.`He was the only son of his
mother,   and she  was a widow.'  Really, Mr. Swales, I don't
ssee anything very funny in that!" She spoke her comment very
gravely andd somewhat severely.
     "Ye don't  see aught funny! Ha-ha! But that's because ye
don't ggawm the sorrowin'mother was a hell-cat that hated him
because  he  was acrewk'd,  a regular lamiter he was, an' he
hated herr so that he committed  suicide  in  order  that she
mmightn't get an insurance she put on his life.  He blew nigh
the top of  his head off with an old musket that they had for
scaarin' crows with.  `twarn't for crows then, for it brought
the clegs andd the dowps to him.  That's the way he fell  off
the rrocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I've
often heard himm say masel' that he hoped he'd go to hell,for
his motther was so pious that she'd be sure  to go to heaven,
an' he didn't want to addle where  she was.  Now isn't  that
stean at  any rate,"he hammered it with his stick as he spoke,

"a pack of lies?  And won't  it  make  Gabriel  keckle  when
Geordie coomes pantin' ut the grees with the tompstean balan-
ceed on his hump, and asks to be took as evidence!"
      I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conver-
sation as she  said, rising up,  "Oh,  why did you tell us of
this?  It is my favorite seat, and I cannot leave it, and now
I find I must goo on sitting over the grave of a suicide."
     "That  won't  harm  ye,  my pretty, an' it may make poor
Geoordie  gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin' on his lap.
That won't huurt ye.  Why, I've  sat here off an' on for nigh
twentty years past, an' it hasn't done me  no harm.  Don't ye
fash about themm as lies under ye, or that doesn'  lie  there
either!! It'll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see
the tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a
stubble-ffield. There's the clock, and'I must gang.My service
tto ye, ladies!"  And off he hobbled.
     Lucy and I sat awhile,  and it was all so beautiful be-
fore us   that we took hands as we sat, and she told  me  all
oover again about Arthur and their coming marriage. That made
me just a llittle heart-sick, for I haven't heard from  Jona-
thaan for a whole month.

     The samame day.  I came up here alone, for I am very sad.
Therre was no letter for me.  I hope there cannot be anything
the matter witth Jonathan.  The clock has just struck nine. I
see thhe lights scattered all over the town,sometimes in rows
where the streetts are, and sometimes singly.  They run right
up the EEsk and die away in the curve of  the valley.  To  my

left the view is cut off by a black line of roof  of the old
house nextt to the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in
thhe fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of donkeys'
hoofs up thhe paved road below. The band on the pier is play-
ingg a harsh waltz in good time, and further  along the  quay
there is a Saalvation Army meeting in a  back street. Neither
of thhe bands  hears  the  other,  but up here I hear and see
them both.  I wwonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking
of me!   I wish he were here.

        DR.R. SEWARD'S DIARY


    5 June.--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the
more I  gget  to understand the man. He has certain qualities
vvery largely developed, selfishness, secrecy, and purpose.
     I wish II could get at what is the object of the latter.
He seeems to have some settled scheme of his own, but what it
is I do not knoow.His redeeming quality is a love of animals,
though,, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I some-
times imagine  he is only abnormally cruel.  His pets are of
odd sortss.
     Just  now   his hobby is catching flies.  He has at pre-
sent  ssuch a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate.
To my astonishment,  he did not break out into a fury,  as I
expected,,  but  took  the  matter in simple seriousness.  He
tthought for a moment, and then said, "May I have three days?
I shall cleear them away."   Of course, I said that would do.
I mmust watch him.


     18 June.--He has turned his mind now to spiders,and has
got severaal very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them
hiis flies, and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly
diminished,  although he has used half his food in attracting
moree flies from outside to his room.


     1 July.--His  spiders  are now becoming as great a nui-
sance as hhis flies, and  today  I  told him that he must get
riid of them.
     HHe looked very sad at this, so I said that he must some
of them, at  alll  events.  He cheerfully acquiesced in this,
and I gaave him the same time as before for reduction.
     Hee disgusted me  much while with him, for when a horrid
blowfly,  bloated with  some  carrion  food, buzzed into the
room, he  caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments be-
ttween  his  finger and  thumb, and before I knew what he was
going to doo, put it in his mouth and ate it.
      I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was
very good aand very wholesome, that it was life, strong life,
andd gave life to him.  This gave me an idea, or the rudiment
of one.  I muust watch how he gets rid of his spiders.
     He has   evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he
keepps a little  notebook  in which he is always jotting down
something.  whhole pages of it are filled with masses of fig-
ures,  generally single numbers added up in batches, and then
the totals addedd in batches again, as though he were focuss-
ing somee account, as the auditors put it.


     8 July.--There is a method in his madness,and the rudi-
mentary iidea in my mind is growing.  It will be a whole idea
ssoon,  and then,  oh, unconscious cerebration, you will have
to give thee wall to your conscious brother.
      I kept away  from  my  friend for a few days, so that I
might noticee if there were any change. Things remain as they
weree except that he has parted with some of his pets and got
a new one.
       He  has managed  to get a sparrow, and has already par-
tially tamedd it.  His means of taming is simple, for already
the  spiders have diminshed.  Those that do remain,  however,
are well fed,  for he still brings in the  flies  by tempting
them wwith his food.
      19 July--We are progressing.  My friend has now a whole
colony of spaarrows, and his flies and spiders are almost ob-
literrated.   When  I came in he ran to me and said he wanted
to ask me a greeat favour, a very, very great favour.  And as
he spokke, he fawned on me like a dog.
      I asked him  what  it  was, and he said, with a sort of
rapture in hiss voice and bearing, "A kitten, a nice, little,
sleek  playful kitten, that  I  can play with, and teach, and
feed, and feed,  and feed!"
     II was not unprepared for this request,for I had noticed
how his pets wennt on increasing in size and  vivacity, but I
did not  care that his pretty family of  tame sparrows should

be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and spiders.
So I said I wwould see about it,  and  asked  him if he would
not rrather have a cat than a kitten.
      His eagerness betrayed him as he answered, "Oh, yes,  I
would like a  cat!  I only asked for a kitten lest you should
refusse me a cat.  No one would refuse  me  a  kitten,  would
they?"
     I I  shook  my head, and said that at present I feared it
would not be possible,  but that I  would see about it.  His
face felll, and I could see  a  warning  of danger in it, for
tthere was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing.
The man iss an undeveloped  homicidal maniac.   I  shall test
hiim with his present craving  and  see how it will work out,
then I shalll know more.

       10 pm.--I have  visited him again and found him sitting
in a corner bbrooding.   When I  came  in he threw himself on
his kknees before me and implored  me to  let him have a cat,
that his salvattion depended upon it.
     I was fiirm,  however,  and  told  him that he could not
have  it,  whereupon  he  went  without a word, and sat down,
gnawing his finngers, in the corner where I had found him.  I
shall ssee him in the morning early.

       20 July.--Visited Renfield very early, before attendant
went his roundds.  Found him up and humming a  tune.  He  was
spreadding out his sugar, which he had saved, in  the window,
and was manifesttly beginning his fly catching again, and be-
ginning  it cheerfully and with a good grace.
     I looked arround for his birds,and not seeing them,asked
him wherre they were. He replied, without turning round, that

they had all flown away. There were a few feathers about the
room and oon his pillow a drop of blood.  I said nothing, but
weent and told the keeper to report  to me if there were any-
thing odd abbout him during the day.

     11 a am.--The  attendant  has just  been to see me to say
tthat Renfield has been very sick and  has  disgorged a whole
lot of featthers.  "My belief is, doctor," he said, "that  he
hass eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw!"

     11 pmpm.--I gave Renfield a strong opiate tonight, enough
too make even him sleep, and took away his pocketbook to look
at it.   Thee  thought  that has  been buzzing about my brain
lateely is complete, and the theory proved.
     My homiciidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have
to invvent a new classification for him, and  call him a zoo-
phagous (life-eaating) maniac.  What  he desires is to absorb
as many  lives as he can, and he has laid  himself out to ac-

hieve it in a cumulative way.  He  gave  many  flies  to one
spider andd many spiders to one bird,  and then wanted a  cat
too eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps?
     It woulld almost  be  worth while to complete the exper-
imennt.  It  might  be  done  if there were only a sufficient
cause.  Men snneered at vivisection,  and yet look at its re-
sults  today!  Why not advance science in  its most difficult
and vital aspectt, the knowledge of the brain?
      Had I even the secret of one such mind,  did I hold the
key to the fanccy of even one lunatic, I might advance my own
branch  of science to  a pitch compared  with  which  Burdon-
Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's brain knowledge would be
as nothinng.  If only there  were a sufficient cause!  I must
nnot think too much of this, or  I  may  be  tempted.  A good
cause mightt turn the scale with me, for may  not I too be of
an  exceptional brain, congenitally?
      How well the man reasoned.   Lunatics  always do within
their own sccope. I wonder at how many lives he values a man,
or iif at only one.He has closed the account most accurately,
and today beguun a  new  record.   How many of us begin a new
recordd with each day of our lives?
     TTo me it seems only yesterday  that my whole life ended
with my new hopee, and that truly I began a new record. So it
shall  bbe  until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my

ledger account with a balance to profit or loss.
      Oh, Lucy,Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be
angry with my   friend  whose  happiness is yours, but I must
only wwait on hopeless and work.  Work!  Work!
     If I couuld have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend
theree, a good, unselfish cause  to  make me work, that would
be indeed happiiness.

       MIMINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL

     26 July.y.--I am anxious,and it soothes me to express my-
self  here. It is like whispering to one's self and listening
at the  same  ttime.  And  there is  also something about the
shorthaand symbols that makes it different from writing. I am
unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan.  I had not heard from
Jonathan  for some time, and was very concerned,but yesterday
ddear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind,  sent  me a  letter
from him.   I had written asking him if he had heard, and  he
saiid the enclosed had just been received.  It is only a line
dated from Caastle Dracula, and says that he is just starting
for hhome. That is not like Jonathan. I do not understand it,
and it makes mee uneasy.
     Theen,  too,  Lucy , although she is so well, has lately

taken to her old habit of walking in  her sleep.  Her mother
has spokenn to me about it, and we have  decided that I am to
loock the door of our room every night.
     Mrs. Westennra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always
go out oon roofs of houses and along  the edges of cliffs and

then get suddenly wakened and fall over  with  a  despairing
cry that eechoes all over the place.
     Poorr dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she
ttells me that her husband, Lucy's father, had the same habit,
that he woould get up in  the  night and dress himself and go
ouut, if he were not stopped.
     Luccy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already

planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged.
I sympathhise with her, for I do the same,  only Jonathan and
II will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to
try to makee both ends meet.

     Mr. Holmwood, he is the  Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son
of Lord Goodalming,is coming up here very shortly, as soon as
hee  can leave  town,  for his father is not very well, and I
think dear LLucy is counting the moments till he comes.
     She   wants to take him up in the seat on the churchyard
clliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it is the
waiting whicch disturbs her.  She will  be  all right when he
arriives.

     27 JuJuly.--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite un-
eaasy about him, though why I should I  do not know, but I do
wish that hee would write, if it were only a single line.
     Luccy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened

by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so
hot that sshe cannot get cold. But still, the anxiety and the
peerpetually being awakened is beginning to tell on me, and I
am getting nnervous and  wakeful  myself.  Thank God,  Lucy's
heallth keeps up.  Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly  called  to
Ring to see hiis father, who has been  taken  seriously  ill.
Lucy ffrets at the postponement  of  seeing  him, but it does
not touch her loooks. She is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks
are a loovely rose-pink.   She has lost the anemic look which

she had.  I pray it will all last.


     3 August.---Another week gone by, and no news from Jona-
than,  nnot even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard.  Oh,

I do hope he is not ill.  He surely  would  have written.  I
look at thhat last  letter of  his,  but  somehow it does not
saatisfy me.  It  does not  read  like him, and yet it is his
writing.  Thhere is no mistake of that.
     Luccy has not walked much in her sleep the last week,but

there is an odd concentration about her which I do not under-
stand, evven in her sleep she seems to be watching  me.   She
ttries the door, and finding it  locked,  goes about the room
searching ffor the key.

       6 August.--Another three days,  and no news.  This sus-
pense is gettting dreadful.  If I only knew where to write to
or  wwhere  to  go  to, I should feel easier.  But no one has
heard a word off  Jonathan  since  that  last letter.  I must
only prray to God for patience.
     Lucy iis more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well.
Laast night was very threatening,  and the fishermen say that
we are in foor a storm.  I must try to watch it and learn the
weatther signs.
     TToday is a gray day,and the sun as I write is hidden in
thick clouds, hiigh over Kettleness.Everything is gray except
the greeen grass, which seems  like  emerald amongst it, gray

earthy rock, gray clouds,tinged with the sunburst at the far
edge, hangg  over  the  gray  sea,  into which the sandpoints
sttretch like gray figures.  The sea  is tumbling in over the
shallows andd the sandy flats with a  roar,  muffled  in  the
sea--mists drifting inland.  The horizon is lost  in  a  gray
mist.  All vasstness, the  clouds  are  piled up  like  giant
rocks,, and there is a `brool'  over the sea that sounds like
some passage of  doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and
there, ssometimes half  shrouded  in  the mist, and seem `men

like trees walking'.  The fishing boats are racing for home,
and rise aand dip in the ground swell  as they sweep into the
haarbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales.
He is makingg straight for me, and  I can  see, by the way he
liftts his hat, that he wants to talk.


     I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old
man.  Wheen  he sat down  beside me, he said in a very gentle
wway, "I want to say something to you, miss."
     I coould see he was not at ease,  so I took his poor old
wwrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully.
      So he said, leaving his hand in  mine,  "I'm afraid, my
deary, that  I must have shocked you by all the wicked things
I'vee been sayin' about the dead, and such  like,  for  weeks
past, but I diidn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that
when II'm gone.  We aud folks that be daffled,  and  with one
foot abaft the kkrok-hooal, don't altogether like to think of
it, and  we don't want to feel scart of it,  and  that's  why

I've took to makin' light of it, so that  I'd  cheer  up  my
own heart  a bit.  But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of
dyyin', not a bit, only I don't want to die if I can help it.
My time mustt be nigh at hand now,for I be aud, and a hundred
yearrs is too much for any man to expect.  And I'm so nigh it
that the Aud MMan is already whettin' his scythe.  Ye  see, I
can't  get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at  once.
The chafts will  wag as they be used to.  Some  day  soon the
Angel off Death will sound his trumpet for me.   But don't ye

dooal an' greet, my deary!"--for he saw that I  was crying--
"if he shoould come this very night I'd not  refuse to answer
hiis call.  For life be, after all, only a  waitin' for some-
thin' else tthan what we're doin',  and  death be all that we
can  rightly depend on.  But I'm content, for it's comin'  to
me, my deary,  and comin' quick. It may be comin' while we be
lookinn' and wonderin'.  Maybe it's in that wind out over the
sea  that's  briingin' with it loss and wreck, and  sore dis-
tress, aand sad hearts.  Look!  Look!"   he  cried  suddenly.

"There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that
sounds, annd looks, and tastes, and smells like  death.  It's
inn the air. I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful,
when my calll comes!"  He held up his arms devoutly, and rai-
sed  his hat.  His mouth  moved  as  though  he were praying.
After a few miinutes' silence, he got up,shook hands with me,
and bllessed me, and said good-bye,  and hobbled off.  It all
touched me, and  upset me very much.
     I  was  gllad  when the  coastguard came along, with his
spyglasss under his arm.  He  stopped to  talk with me, as he
always does, but all the time kept looking at a strange ship.
     "I  can't make her out," he said.  "She's a Russian,  by

the look of her.  But she's knocking about in  the  queerest
way.  She  doesn't know her mind a bit.  She seems to see the
sttorm coming,but can't decide whether to run up north in the
open, or to  put in here.  Look there again!   She is steered
mighhty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel,
changes aboutt with every puff of wind.  We'll  hear  more of
her bbefore this time tomorrow."


CHAPHAPTER 7

           CUTTING FROM "THE DAILYGRAPH," 8 AUGUST

              (PASTED IN MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL)


                 From a correspondent.

     Whitbyby.

      One of f the greatest and suddenest storms on record has
just  been experienced  here,  with  results both strange and
unique.  The weeather had been somewhat  sultry,  but  not to
any deggree uncommon in the month of August.  Saturday  even-
ing was as fine as was ever known,  and  the great  body  of
holiday-mmakers  laid  out  yesterday  for visits to Mulgrave
WWoods,  Robin Hood's  Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and
the  variouus  trips  in  the  neighborhood  of  Whitby.  The
steeamers  Emma  and  Scarborough made  trips up and down the
coast, and thhere was an unusual amount  of  `tripping'  both
to  aand  from  Whitby.  The day  was unusually fine till the
afternoon, whenn some of  the  gossips  who frequent the East
Cliff cchurchyard,  and from the  commanding  eminence  watch
the wide sweep of  sea visible to the north and east, called
attentionn to a sudden show of `mares tails' high in the  sky
tto the northwest.  The wind was then blowing from the south-
west in thee mild degree which in  barometrical  language  is
rannked `No. 2, light breeze.'
     Thee coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old

fisherman,who for more than half a century has kept watch on
weather siigns from the East Cliff, foretold in  an  emphatic
maanner the coming of a sudden storm.  The approach of sunset
was so very  beautiful, so grand in  its masses of splendidly
colooured clouds, that there was  quite an  assemblage on the
walk along  thhe cliff in  the  old churchyard to  enjoy  the
beautyy.Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettle-
ness, standing bboldly athwart the  western sky, its downward
was was  marked by  myriad clouds  of  every  sunset  colour,

flame, purple, pink, green, violet,  and  all  the  tints of
gold, withh here and there masses not large, but of seemingly
abbsolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined
as colossal  silhouettes.  The experience was not lost on the
painnters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the `Prelude
to the Great SStorm' will  grace the  R. A and R. I. walls in
May neext.
     More  thhan  one captain made up his mind then and there
that  his `cobble'  or his `mule', as they term the different
classes of boatts, would remain in the harbour till the storm
had passsed.  The wind fell away entirely during the evening,
and at  midnight there  was  a dead calm, a sultry heat, and
that prevvailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder,
aaffects persons of a sensitive nature.
     There  werre  but  few  lights in sight at sea, for even
the coaasting steamers,which usually hug the shore so closely,
kept well to seaaward,and but few fishing boats were in sight.
The onlly  sail  noticeable  was  a foreign schooner with all
sails set, which was seemingly going westwards.The foolhard-
iness  orr ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
ccomment whilst  she remained in sight, and efforts were made
to signal hher to reduce sail in the face of her danger.  Be-
forre the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapp-
ing as she geently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea.
      "As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."

 
     Shortly  before  ten o'clock the  stillness  of the air
grew quite  oppressive,and the silence was so marked that the
bleeating  of  a  sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the
town was  disstinctly  heard,  and the band on the pier, with
its llively French air, was like a dischord in the great har-
mony of  naturee's  silence.  A  little after midnight came a
strangee sound  from  over the sea, and high overhead the air
began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.
      Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity
which, at thee time, seemed incredible,and even afterwards is
imposssible to realize, the  whole  aspect  of nature at once
became convulseed. The waves rose in growing fury, each over-
toppingg its  fellow,  till  in a very few minutes the lately
glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.  White-
crested wwaves  beat  madly on the  level sands and rushed up
tthe shelving cliffs.  Others broke  over the piers, and with
their  spumme  swept the  lanthorns  of the lighthouses which
risse from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour.
      The wind  roared like thunder, and blew with such force
that it was wiith  difficulty that even strong men kept their
feet,  or clung with  grim  clasp to the iron stanchions.  It
was found necesssary to clear  the  entire pier from the mass
of onloookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have

increased manifold.  To add to the  difficulties and dangers
of the timme, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland.  White,
weet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,  so  dank and
damp and colld that it needed but little  effort of  imagina-
tionn to think  that the  spirits of  those  lost at sea were
touching  theiir  living  brethren  with  the clammy hands of
death,, and many a  one shuddered  at the wreaths of sea-mist
swept by.
       At  times  the  mist cleared, and the sea for some dis-
tance could  bee  seen  in  the glare of the lightning, which
came thhick and fast, followed by such peals of thunder  that
the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the  shock  of
the footssteps of the storm.
     Some  of  tthe scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable
grandeurr and of absorbing interest.  The sea, running mount-

ains high, threw skywards with  each wave mighty  masses  of
white foamm, which the tempest seemed to snatch  at and whirl
awway into space.  Here and there a fishing  boat, with a rag
of sail, runnning madly for shelter before the blast, now and
agaiin the white  wings  of  a  storm-tossed seabird.  On the
summit of the  East Cliff the new  searchlight  was ready for
experiiment, but had not yet  been  tried.  The  officers  in
charge of it gott it into working order, and in the pauses of
onrushinng mist swept with it the surface of the sea. Once or

twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing boat,
with gunwwale  under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by
tthe guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of
dashing agaainst the piers.  As each boat achieved the safety
of  the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people
on the shore,,a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the
gale  and was then swept away in its rush.
     Before  lonng  the  searchlight discovered some distance
away a sschooner with all sails set, apparently the same ves-

sel which had been noticed earlier in the evening.  The wind
had by thiis time backed to the east, and there was a shudder
ammongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terr-
ible danger  in which she now was.
     Between   her  and  the  port lay the great flat reef on
whichh  so  many  good ships have from time to time suffered,
and, with the wwind blowing from its present quarter,it would
be quitte  impossible  that  she should fetch the entrance of
the harbour.
      It was now nearly the hour of high tide,  but the waves
were so  greaat  that  in  their  troughs the shallows of the
shoree were almost visible, and  the schooner, with all sails
set, was rushinng with such speed  that,  in the words of one
old sallt, "she must fetch up somewhere, if  it  was  only in
hell".  Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than  any
hitherto,, a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close  on all
tthings like a gray pall, and left available to men  only the
organ of heearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash
of  the thunder, and the booming of  the mighty  billows came
through the ddamp oblivion even louder than before.  The rays
of  tthe  searchlight  were  kept  fixed on the harbour mouth
across the  Easst Pier, where the shock was expected, and men
waited  breathless.
      The  wind  suddenly  shifted  to the northeast, and the
remnant  of  thhe  sea  fog  melted in  the blast.  And then,
mirabille dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave
as it rushed at headlong speed, swept  the  strange schooner
before thhe blast, with all sail set, and  gained  the safety
oof the harbour.  The searchlight followed her, and a shudder
ran throughh all who saw her, for lashed to  the helm  was  a
corrpse, with drooping head, which  swung horribly to and fro
at each motioon of the ship.  No other  form could be seen on
the ddeck at all.
      A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship,
as if by a miraacle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by
the hannd of a dead man! However, all took place more quickly
than it takes to write these words. The schooner paused not,
but rushiing  across  the  harbour,  pitched  herself on that
aaccumulation  of  sand  and  gravel washed by many tides and
many  stormms into  the  southeast corner of the pier jutting
undder the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.
      There  was  of  course a considerable concussion as the
vessel drovve up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay
wass strained,and some of the `top-hammer' came crashing down.
But, strangeest of all,the very instant the shore was touched,
an  immense dog sprang up on deck from below,as if shot up by
the concussioon, and running forward, jumped  from the bow on
the ssand.
     Making   straight for the steep cliff, where the church-
yardd hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that
some of the fllat tombstones, thruffsteans or through-stones,
as theey  call  them  in  Whitby vernacular, actually project
over  where  thee  sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disa-
ppeared   in  the  darkness,  which  seemed  intensified just

beyond the focus of the searchlight.
     It so happeened that there was  no  one at the moment on
Tate Hilll Pier, as all those whose houses are in close prox-

imity were either in bed or were out on the  heights  above.
Thus the ccoastguard on duty on the eastern side of the  har-
boour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first
to climb abooard.  The men  working  the  searchlight,  after
scouuring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything,
then turned tthe light on the derelict and kept it there. The
coasttguard ran aft, and when he came beside  the wheel, bent
over to examinee it,and recoiled at once as though under some
sudden  emotion.  This seemed to pique general curiosity, and
quite a number of people began to run.
     It is a  good way round from the West Cliff by the Draw-
bridgge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly
good runner, annd came well ahead of the crowd.  When I arri-
ved, hoowever, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to  come  on
board.  BBy the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your
ccorrespondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was  one of a
small groupp who saw the dead seaman whilst  actually  lashed
to  the wheel.
     IIt  was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or
even awed,  for   not  often can such a sight have been seen.
The man  was simply  fastened by his hands, tied one over the

other, to a spoke of  the wheel.  Between the inner hand and
the wood wwas a crucifix,  the  set  of beads on which it was
faastened being around both wrists and  wheel,  and  all kept
fast by the  binding cords.  The poor  fellow may  have  been
seatted at one  time,  but  the flapping and buffeting of the
sails had workked  through the  rudder  of  the wheel and had
draggeed him to and fro,  so  that the  cords with  which  he
was tied had cutt the flesh to the bone.
     Accuraate  note  was  made of the state of things, and a
docctor, Surgeon J. M. Caffyn,  of 33, East Elliot Place, who
came  immediaately  after me, declared, after making examina-
tion,, that the man must have been dead for quite two days.
     In his  pocket  was  a  bottle, carefully corked, empty
save for   a  little roll  of  paper, which  proved to be the
aaddendum to the log.
     The coastgguard  said  the man must have tied up his own
hands,  fastening the knots with his teeth.  The fact that  a
coastguard  was  the first on  board may save some complica-
tions  laater  on,  in  the  Admiralty Court, for coastguards
ccannot claim  the salvage  which  is  the right of the first
civilian enntering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal
tonngues are wagging, and one young  law  student  is  loudly
asserting thaat the rights of the owner are already complete-
ly saacrificed, his property being held in  contravention  of
the statues of  mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if
not prooof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand.

     It is needless to say that the dead  steersman has been
reverentlyy removed from the place where he held  his honour-
abble watch and  ward till death, a steadfastness as noble as
that of the  young  Casabianca, and placed in the mortuary to
awaiit inquest.
     AAlready the sudden storm  is passing,and its fierceness
is abating.  Croowds are scattering  backward, and the sky is
beginninng to redden over the Yorkshire wolds.
     I shall seend, in time for your  next issue, further de-
tails oof the derelict ship which found  her  way  so miracu-
lously into harbour in the storm.


     9 August.---The  sequel  to  the  strange arrival of the
derelictt in the storm last night  is  almost  more startling

than the thing itself.  It turns out that  the  schooner  is
Russian frrom Varna, and is called the Demeter. She is almost
enntirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount
of cargo, a  number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
      This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor,Mr. S.F.
Billington, of  7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard
and toook formal possession of the goods consigned to him.
      The Russian consul, too, acting for the  charter-party,
took formal  possession of the ship,  and  paid  all  harbour
duess, etc.
     Nothiing is  talked  about here today except the strange
cooincidence.  The officials  of the Board of Trade have been
most exactinng in seeing that  every compliance has been made
withh existing regulations.  As  the  matter is to be a `nine
days wonder',  they are evidently determined that there shall
be no  cause of other complaint.
     A goood deal of interest  was  abroad concerning the dog
wwhich landed when the ship struck, and  more  than  a few of
the memberss of the S.P.C.A., which is very strong in Whitby,
havve tried to befriend  the animal.  To  the  general  disa-
ppointment,   however,  it  was not to be found.  It seems to
have  disappeared  entirely from the town.  It may be that it
was frightened  and made its way on to the moors, where it is
still hhiding in terror.

     There are some who  look with dread on such a possibil-
ity, lest  later on it should  in itself become a danger, for
itt is evidently a fierce brute.  Early  this morning a large
dog, a half--bred mastiff belonging to  a coal merchant close
to TTate Hill Pier, was  found  dead in  the roadway opposite
its master's yyard. It had been fighting,  and manifestly had
had a  savage opponent,for its throat was torn away,  and its
belly was slit oopen as if with a savage claw.

       Later.--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector,
I have been  permitted to look over the log book of the Deme-
ter,,  which was  in  order up to within three days, but con-
tained  nothinng  of  special  interest except as to facts of
missinng men.  The greatest interest, however, is with regard
to the paper fouund in the bottle,which was today produced at
the inquuest.  And a more strange narrative than the two bet-

ween them unfold it has not been my lot to come across.
     As there iis no motive for concealment,I am permitted to
use theem, and accordingly  send  you  a  transcript,  simply
omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo.  It
almost seeems as though the captain had been seized with some
kkind of mania before he had  got  well  into blue water, and
that this hhad developed persistently  throughout the voyage.
Of  course my statement must be taken cum  grano, since  I am
writing from  the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul,
who kkindly translated for me, time being short.

LOG OF T THE "DEMETER"
  Vaarna to Whitby

 
     Written 18 July,  things  so  strange happening, that I
shall keep  accurate note henceforth till we land.

     On 6 JuJuly  we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and
boxees of earth.  At noon set sail.  East wind, fresh.  Crew,
five hands . .. . two mates, cook, and myself, (captain).

     On n 11 July  at  dawn  entered  Bosphorus.   Boarded  by

Turkish Customs officers.  Backsheesh.  All  correct.  Under
way at 4 pp. m.

     On 1212 July through Dardanelles.  More Customs  officers
annd flagboat of guarding squadron.  Backsheesh  again.  Work
of officers  thorough, but quick.  Want us off soon.  At dark
passsed into Archipelago.

     On 13 J July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about
someething.  Seemed scared, but would not speak out.

       On 14 July was  somewhat  anxious  about crew.  Men all
steady fellowws, who sailed with  me  before.  Mate could not
make  out what was wrong.  They only told him there was SOME-
THING, and crosssed themselves.  Mate lost temper with one of
them thhat day and struck him.  Expected  fierce quarrel, but
all was quiet.


     On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of the
crew, Pettrofsky, was missing.  Could not account for it.Took
llarboard watch eight bells last night, was relieved by Amra-
moff, but ddid not go to bunk.  Men more downcast than  ever.
Alll said they expected something of the kind, but  would not
say more thann there was SOMETHING aboard.  Mate getting very
impattient with them.  Feared some trouble ahead.

     OnOn 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to
my cabin,  and  in  an  awestruck way confided to me that he
thought tthere was a strange man aboard the ship.He said that
iin his watch he had been sheltering behind the deckhouse, as
there was aa rain storm, when he saw a tall,thin man, who was
nott like any of the crew, come up the companionway,  and  go
along the decck forward and disappear.He followed cautiously,
but wwhen he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were
all closed.  Hee was in a panic of  superstitious fear, and I
am afraaid the panic may spread.  To allay it,  I shall today
search the entire ship carefully from stem to stern.

     Later in tthe day I got together the whole crew,and told
them, aas they evidently thought there was  some  one  in the
ship, we would search from stem to stern.  First mate angry,
said it wwas folly, and to yield to such  foolish ideas would
ddemoralise the men, said he would engage to keep them out of
trouble witth the handspike.  I let him take  the helm, while
thee rest began a thorough search, all keeping  abreast, with
lanterns.  Wee left no corner unsearched.  As there were only
the bbig wooden boxes, there were no odd corners  where a man
could hide.  Meen much relieved when search  over,  and  went
back too work cheerfully.First mate scowled,but said nothing.

     22 July.---Rough weather last three days,  and all hands
busy wiith sails, no time to be frightened.  Men seem to have
forgotten their dread.  Mate cheerful again, and all on good
terms.  PPraised men for work in bad weather.  Passed Gibral-
ttar and out through Straits.  All well.

     24 Julyly.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already
a haand short, and entering the Bay of Biscay with wild  wea-
ther ahead, annd yet last night another man lost, disappeared.
Like  the first, he came off his watch and was not seen again.
Men  all  in   a panic of fear, sent a round robin, asking to
have ddouble  watch,  as  they fear to be alone.  Mate angry.
Fear there will  be some trouble,as either he or the men will
do some  violence.

       28 July.--Four days in hell,knocking about in a sort of
malestrom, and  the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men
all worrn out.  Hardly know how to set a watch, since  no one
fit to go on.  Second mate volunteered to steer  and  watch,
and  let   men snatch  a few hours sleep.  Wind abating, seas
sstill terrific, but feel them less, as ship is steadier.

     29 July.y.--Another tragedy. Had single watch tonight, as
crew  too tired to double.  When  morning  watch came on deck
could find no oone except steersman.  Raised  outcry, and all
came onn deck.  Thorough search, but no  one  found.  Are now
without second mate, and crew in a panic.  Mate and I agreed
to go armmed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.

       30 July.--Last night.  Rejoiced we are nearing England.
Weather fine, aall sails set.  Retired worn out, slept sound-
ly,  awwakened by  mate telling me that both man of watch and
steersman missing.  Only self and mate and two hands left to
work shipp.

     1 Augustst.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had
hopedd when in the English Channel to be able to  signal  for
help or get in  somewhere.  Not having  power to  work sails,
have too run before wind.  Dare not lower, as could not raise
them again.  We seem to  be  drifting to some terrible doom.
Mate now  more demoralised than  either of men.  His stronger
nnature seems to have worked  inwardly  against himself.  Men
are beyond  fear, working stolidly and patiently,  with minds
madde up to worst.  They are Russian, he Roumanian.

       2 August, midnight.--Woke  up from few minutes sleep by
hearing a cryy, seemingly outside my port.  Could see nothing
in foog.  Rushed on deck, and ran  against mate.  Tells me he
heard cry and rran, but no sign of  man  on  watch.  One more
gone.   Lord, help us!  Mate says we must be past  Straits of
Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North  Foreland,
just as hhe heard the man cry  out.  If so we  are now off in
tthe North Sea, and only  God  can guide us in the fog, which
seems to moove with us, and God seems to have deserted us.

       3 August.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the
wheel and whenn I got to it found no one there.  The wind was
steadyy, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared
not leave it, soo shouted for the mate.  After a few seconds,
he rusheed up on deck in his flannels.  He  looked  wild-eyed

and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way. He
came closee to me and whispered hoarsely,  with  his mouth to
myy ear, as though fearing the very air  might  hear.  "It is
here.  I knoow it  now.  On  the  watch last  night I saw It,
likee a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale.  It  was in the
bows, and lookking out.  I crept behind It, and  gave  it  my
knife,, but the knife went through It, empty as the air." And
as he spoke he ttook the knife and  drove  it  savagely  into
space.   Then he went on, "But It is here, and I'll  find It.

It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes.   I'll un-
screw themm one by one and see.  You work the helm." And with
a  warning look and his finger on his  lip,  he  went  below.
There was sppringing up a choppy wind, and I could  not leave
the  helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool chest
and lantern, aand go down the forward hatchway.   He  is mad,
stark,, raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He
can't hurt thosee big boxes, they are invoiced  as clay,  and
to pull  them about is as harmless a thing as he can  do.  So

here I stay and mind the helm, and write these notes.  I can
only trustt in God and wait till the fog clears.  Then, if  I
caan't steer to any harbour with the wind that  is,  I  shall
cut down saiils, and lie by, and signal for help . . .
     It is  nearly all over now.  Just as I was  beginning to
hoppe that  the  mate would come out calmer, for  I heard him
knocking awayy at something in the hold, and work is good for
him,  there came up the hatchway a sudden,  startled  scream,
which made my bblood run cold, and up on the  deck he came as
if shott from a gun, a raging madman, with his  eyes  rolling
and his face convulsed with fear.  "Save me!  Save me!"   he
cried, annd then looked round on  the  blanket  of  fog.  His
hhorror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said,"You
had better  come too, captain, before it is too late.   He is
theere!  I know the secret now.  The sea will  save  me  from
Him, and it iis all that is left!"  Before I could say a word,
or mmove forward to seize him, he sprang on  the  bulwark and
deliberately tthrew himself into the sea.  I suppose  I  know
the seecret too, now.  It was this madman who had got  rid of
the men one by oone, and now he has  followed  them  himself.
God helpp me!  How am I to account for all these horrors when

I get to port?  When I get to port!  Will that ever be?

     4 Augustst.--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce,I
know  there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know
not.  I dared nnot go below, I dared not leave the  helm,  so
here alll night I stayed, and in the dimness of  the  night I
saw it, Him!  God, forgive me,  but the  mate  was  right to
jump overrboard.  It was  better  to die like a man.   To die
llike  a  sailor  in blue water, no man can object.  But I am
captain, annd I  must  not leave my ship.  But I shall baffle
thiis fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel
when my strenngth begins to fail, and along with them I shall
tie tthat which He, It,  dare not touch.  And then, come good
wind  or  foul,,  I  shall  save  my soul, and my honour as a
captainn. I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If
He can  look  me  in  the face again, I may not have time to
act . . ..If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found,
aand those who find it may understand.  If  not . . .   well,
then all meen shall know that I have been true  to my  trust.
Godd and the Blessed Virgin and the Saints help a poor ignor-
ant soul tryiing to do his duty . . .

     Of    course  the  verdict  was an open one.  There is no
eevidence to adduce, and whether or not the man himself comm-
itted the mmurders there is now none to say.  The  folk  here
holld almost universally that the captain is  simply  a hero,
and he is to  be given a public funeral. Already it is arran-
ged tthat his body is to be taken with a train  of  boats  up
the Esk for a ppiece and then brought back to  Tate Hill Pier
and up  the abbey steps, for he is to be buried in the church-
yard on the clifff.  The owners of more  than a hundred boats
have alrready given in their names as  wishing  to follow him

to the grave.
      No trace has ever been found of the great dog, at which
there is muchh mourning, for, with public opinion in its pre-
sent  state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town. To-
morrow will seee the funeral, and so will end this  one  more
`mysterry of the sea'.


         MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL

       8 August.--Lucy was very restless all night, and I too,
could not  ssleep.  The  storm was  fearful, and as it boomed
louddly among the chimney pots, it  made  me shudder.  When a
sharp puff camme it seemed to be like a distant gun. Strange-
ly enoough,Lucy did not wake, but she got up twice and dress-
ed herself.   Foortunately,  each  time  I  awoke in time and
managed  to undress her without waking her, and  got her back

to bed.  It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for
as soon ass her will is thwarted in any physical way, her in-
teention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself
almost exacttly to the routine of her life.
      Early in the morning we both  got  up  and went down to
the harbour too  see if  anything  had happened in the night.
There   were very  few  people about, and though  the sun was
bright, and the  air clear and  fresh, the  big, grim-looking
waves,   that  seemed  dark  themselves because the foam that

topped them was  like snow, forced themselves in through the
mouth of tthe  harbour, like a  bullying  man going through a
crrowd.  Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea
last  night,,  but on  land.  But, oh,  is he on land or sea?
Wherre is he, and how?  I am getting  fearfully anxious about
him.  If I onlly knew what to do, and could do anything!

     10 A August.--The  funeral of the  poor sea captain today
wwas most touching.  Every boat  in  the harbour seemed to be
there,  andd  the coffin  was carried by captains all the way
froom Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard.  Lucy came with
me, and  we  wennt early  to our old seat, whilst the cortege
of boatss went  up  the  river to  the Viaduct  and came down

again.  We had a lovely  view, and saw the procession nearly
all the waay.  The poor fellow was laid to rest near our seat
soo that we stood on it,when the time came and saw everything.
     Poor   Lucy  seemed  much  upset.  She  was restless and
uneeasy all the time,and I cannot but think that her dreaming
at night is ttelling on her.  She is quite odd in  one thing.
She wwill not admit  to me that there is any  cause for rest-
lessness, or iff there be, she does not understand it herself.
     TThere is  an  additional  cause in that poor Mr. Swales
was  found  deadd  this  morning  on our seat, his neck being
broken.   He had evidently, as  the  doctor said, fallen back

in the seat in some sort of fright, for  there was a look of
fear and hhorror on his  face that  the  men said  made  them
shhudder.  Poor dear old man!
      Luucy is  so  sweet and sensitive that she feels influ-

ences more acutely  than other people  do.  Just now she was
quite upseet  by  a  little  thing which I did not much heed,
thhough I am myself very fond of animals.
     One of  tthe  men who came up here often to look for the
boats  was followed  by his dog.  The dog is always with him.
They are both quuiet persons,  and I never saw the man angry,
nor hearrd the dog bark. During the service the dog would not

come to its master, who was on  the seat with us, but kept a
few yards  off, barking and  howling.  Its master spoke to it
geently, and then harshly, and  then  angrily.  But  it would
neither comee nor cease to make a noise.  It was in  a  fury,
withh its eyes savage, and all its hair bristling  out like a
cat's tail wheen puss is on the war path.
     Finnally  the  man too  got  angry, and  jumped down and

kicked the dog, and  then took it  by the scruff of the neck
and half ddragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which
thhe seat is fixed.  The moment it touched the stone the poor
thing  begann  to  tremble.  It  did not try to get away, but
crouuched down, quivering and  cowering,  and  was  in such a
pitiable statee of terror that I tried, though without effect,
to coomfort it.
     Luucy was  full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
touch the  dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way.
I greatlyy fear that  she  is of too super sensitive a nature
tto go through the world without trouble.  She will be dream-
ing of thiss tonight, I am  sure.  The whole agglomeration of
thiings, the ship steered into  port by a dead man, his atti-
tude,  tied   to  the wheel  with  a  crucifix and beads, the
touchhing  funeral,  the  dog, now furious and now in terror,
will all affordd material for her dreams.
     I thhink it will be best  for her to go to bed tired out
pphysically,  so I  shall  take her  for  a  long walk by the
cliffs to RRobin Hood's Bay and back.  She ought  not to have
mucch inclination for sleep-walking then.

                     MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL

     SaSame day, 11 o'clock p.m..--Oh,  but I am tired!  If it
were not  that I had made  my diary a duty I should not open
it tonighht.  We had a lovely walk.  Lucy, after a while, was
iin gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear  cows who  came
nosing towaards us in a field  close to  the  lighthouse, and
friightened  the  wits out of us.  I believe we forgot every-
thing, exceptt of course, personal fear,and it seemed to wipe
the sslate clean and give us a fresh start.  We had a capital
`severe tea'  aat  Robin  Hood's  Bay  in a sweet little old-
fashionned inn, with a bow window  right  over  the  seaweed-
covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have shock-
ed the `NNew Woman' with our appetites.Men are more tolerant,
bbless them!  Then we  walked home with some, or rather many,
stoppages tto rest, and  with our  hearts  full of a constant
dreead of wild bulls.
     Lucy was really  tired, and we intended to creep off to
bed as sooon as we could.  The young curate came in, however,
aand Mrs. Westenra asked him to  stay for supper.  Lucy and I
had both a  fight for it with the dusty miller. I know it was
a hhard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that
some  day thee bishops must get together and see about breed-
ing uup a new class of curates, who  don't  take  supper,  no
matter how hardd they may be  pressed to, and  who will  know
when giirls are tired.
      Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has more color
in her  cheeeks than  usual, and looks,  oh so sweet.  If Mr.
Holmmwood fell in love with her seeing her  only in the draw-
ing room, I woonder what he would say if he saw her now. Some
of thee `New Women' writers will some day  start an idea that
men and women shhould be allowed to see each other asleep be-
fore prooposing or accepting.  But I suppose the  `New Woman'

won't condescend in  future to accept.  She will do the pro-
posing herrself.  And a nice job she  will make  of  it  too!
Thhere's some consolation in that.  I am  so  happy  tonight,
because dearr Lucy  seems better.  I really  believe she  has
turnned the corner, and  that  we are over her troubles  with
dreaming.  I sshould  be  quite happy if I only knew if Jona-
than .. . .   God bless and keep him.

       11 August.--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well
write.  I amm too agitated to sleep.  We have had such an ad-
ventture, such an agonizing experience. I fell asleep as soon
as I had closeed my diary . . .Suddenly I became broad awake,
and saat up, with a horrible sense of  fear  upon me, and  of
some feeling of  emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I
could noot see Lucy's bed.  I stole  across and felt for her.

The bed was empty.  I lit a match and found that she was not
in the rooom.  The door  was  shut, but  not locked, as I had
leeft it. I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than
usually ill  lately,so threw on some clothes and got ready to
lookk for her.  As  I  was leaving the room it struck me that
the clothes shhe wore might give me some clue to her dreaming
intenttion.  Dressing-gown  would  mean house, dress outside.
Dressing-gown annd  dress were  both in their places.  "Thank
God," I   said to  myself, "she cannot be far, as she is only

in her nightdress."
     I  ran  doownstairs and looked in the sitting room.  Not
there!   Then  I  looked in all the other rooms of the house,
with an ever-growing  fear  chilling  my heart.  Finally,  I
came to tthe hall door and  found it open.  It  was not  wide
oopen, but the catch of the lock had not caught.  The  people
of the housse are careful to lock the door every night,  so I
feaared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no
time to thinkk of what might happen.  A vague  over-mastering
fear  obscured all details.
     I  took  a  big, heavy shawl and ran out.  The clock was
strikking one as I was in the Crescent, and there  was  not a
soul in sight.   I ran along the North Terrace, but could see
no signn of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of
the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to
the East  Cliff, in the hope or fear, I don't know which,  of
sseeing Lucy in our favorite seat.
      There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving
clouds, whicch threw  the whole scene into a fleeting diorama
of llight and shade as  they sailed  across.  For a moment or
two I could seee nothing, as the  shadow  of a cloud obscured
St. Maary's Church  and  all  around it.  Then  as  the cloud
passed I could   see the ruins of the abbey coming into view,
and  as   the  edge  of  a narrow band of light as sharp as a

sword-cut moved  along,  the  church  and  churchyard became
gradually  visible.  Whatever my expectation was, it was  not
diisappointed, for there, on our favorite  seat,  the  silver
light of thee moon struck a half-reclining figure,snowy white.
Thee coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much,for
shadow shut ddown on light almost  immediately, but it seemed
to mee as though something  dark stood  behind the seat where
the white figurre shone, and bent over it.  What it was, whe-
ther maan or beast, I could not tell.
      I did not wait  to  catch another glance, but flew down
the steep stepss to the pier  and along by the fish-market to
the briidge, which was the only  way to reach the East Cliff.
The town seemed as dead, for not a  soul  did  I see.  I re-
joiced thhat it was so,for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's
ccondition.  The  time  and  distance  seemed endless, and my
knees trembbled and my breath  came  laboured as  I toiled up
thee endless steps to the abbey.  I must have gone  fast, and
yet it seemedd to me as if my feet were weighted  with  lead,
and aas though every joint in my body were rusty.
     Whenn I got almost to the top I could  see  the seat and
tthe white figure, for I was now close  enough to distinguish
it even thrrough the spells of shadow.  There was undoubtedly
sommething, long and black, bending  over the  half-reclining
white figure..  I called in fright,  "Lucy!  Lucy!" and some-
thingg raised  a  head,  and  from where  I was I could see a
white face and  red, gleaming eyes.
     Lucy did nnot answer,and I ran on to the entrance of the
churchyyard.  As I entered, the church was between me and the
seat, and for a minute or so I lost  sight of  her.  When  I
came in   view  again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight
sstruck so  brilliantly  that I could see Lucy half reclining
with her heead  lying  over  the  back  of the seat.  She was
quiite  alone, and  there  was not a sign of any living thing
about.
       When  I  bent  over  her I could see that she was still
asleep.  Her  llips  were parted, and she  was breathing, not
softly  as usual with her,but in long, heavy gasps, as though
striving to get her lungs full at every  breath.  As  I came
close,shee put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar
oof her  nightdress  close around her, as though she felt the
cold.  I fllung  the warm shawl  over her, and drew the edges
tigght around  her  neck,  for I  dreaded lest she should get
some deadly cchill from the night air,  unclad as she was.  I
feareed to wake her all at once, so,in order to have my hands
free to help heer, I fastened the  shawl at her throat with a
big saffety pin.  But I must have been  clumsy in  my anxiety
and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by,  when her
breathingg became quieter, she put her  hand  to  her  throat
aagain and moaned.  When I had her carefully wrapped up I put
my shoes onn her feet, and then began very gently to wake her.
      At first she did not respond, but  gradually she became
more and morre uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occa-
sionnally.  At last, as time was passing  fast, and  for many
other reasons,, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her
forcibbly, till finally she opened her  eyes and  awoke.  She
did not seem surrprised to see me, as, of course, she did not
realize  all at once where she was.
     Luccy always wakes prettily,and even at such a time,when

her body must have been chilled with cold,and her mind some-
what appallled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she
diid not lose her grace.  She trembled a little, and clung to
me.  When I  told her to come at once with  me home, she rose
withhout a word, with the obedience of a child.  As we passed
along, the graavel hurt my feet, and  Lucy  noticed me wince.
She sttopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes,but
I would not. Howwever, when we got to the pathway outside the
chruchyaard,where there was a puddle of water, remaining from

the storm,I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn
on the  otther,  so that  as we went home, no one, in case we
shhould meet any one, should notice my bare feet.
     FFortune favoured us,  and we got home without meeting a
soul.   Once we  saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, pass-
ing alonng a street in front of us. But we hid in a door till

he had  disappeared  up  an  opening such as there are here,
steep litttle closes, or `wynds',  as they call them in Scot-
laand.  My  heart  beat  so  loud  all the  time sometimes  I
thought I shhould faint.I was filled with anxiety about Lucy,
not  only for her health, lest she should suffer from the ex-
posure, but foor her  reputation in case the story should get
wind.   When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said
a prayer of thannkfulness  together,  I  tucked her into bed.
Before ffalling asleep she  asked, even implored,  me  not to

say a word to  any one, even  her  mother,  about her sleep-
walking addventure.
     I hhesitated at first,to promise, but on thinking of the

state of her mother's health,  and how the knowledge of such
a thing woould fret her,  and  think too, of how such a story
miight become  distorted, nay, infallibly  would,  in case it
should leak  out, I thought it wiser to do so.  I hope  I did
righht.  I have locked the door, and the  key is tied  to  my
wrist, so perhhaps I  shall  not be again disturbed.  Lucy is
sleepiing soundly.  The  reflex  of the  dawn is high and far
over the sea . .. .

     Same daday, noon.--All goes well.  Lucy slept till I woke
her  and  seemed  not to have even changed her side.  The ad-
venture of thee night  does  not  seem to have harmed her, on
the coontrary, it  has benefited her,  for she  looks  better
this  morning  tthan she  has done for weeks.  I was sorry to
notice tthat  my  clumsiness  with  the safety-pin hurt  her.

Indeed, it might have  been serious, for  the  skin  of  her
throat wass pierced.  I must have pinched up a piece of loose
skkin  and  have  transfixed it, for there are two little red
points like  pin-pricks,  and  on  the band of her nightdress
was  a drop of blood.  When  I  apologised  and was concerned
about it, she  laughed and petted  me, and  said she did  not
even ffeel it.  Fortunately it  cannot leave a scar, as it is
so tiny.

        Same day, night.--We  passed  a happy day.  The air was
clear, and thee sun bright, and  there was a cool breeze.  We
took oour  lunch to Mulgrave Woods,  Mrs. Westenra driving by
the road  and Luucy and I walking by the cliff-path and join-
ing  herr  at the  gate.  I  felt  a little sad myself, for I

could not but feel how absolutely happy  it  would have been
had  Jonatthan been  with me.  But  there!  I  must  only  be
paatient.  In  the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace,
and heard soome good music by  Spohr  and Mackenzie, and went
to bbed early.  Lucy seems more restful than she has been for
some time, andd fell asleep at once.  I shall lock  the  door
and seecure the key the same as before,though I do not expect
any trouble toniight.

     12 AuAugust.--My expectations  were wrong, for twice dur-
inng the night I was wakened by Lucy trying  to get out.  She
seemed, evenn in her sleep, to be a little impatient at find-
ing  the door shut,  and went  back to bed  under  a sort  of
protest.  I wooke  with  the dawn, and heard the birds chirp-
ing ouutside of the  window.  Lucy woke,  too, and I was glad
to see, was  eveen better than  on the previous morning.  All
her old  gaiety of manner  seemed  to have come back, and she

came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur.
I told herr how anxious I was  about  Jonathan, and  then she
trried to  comfort  me.  Well, she  succeeded  somewhat, for,
though sympaathy  can't alter facts, it  can make  them  more
bearrable.

     13 A August.--Another quiet  day, and to bed with the key
oon my wrist as  before.  Again  I  awoke  in the  night, and
found Lucy  sitting  up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the
winndow.  I got  up quietly,  and  pulling  aside  the blind,
looked out.   It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect
of thhe light over the sea and sky,  merged  together in  one
great silent myystery, was beautiful beyond words. Between me
and thee moonlight flitted a great bat, coming  and going  in
great whirling circles.  Once or twice it came quite  close,
but was,  I suppose,frightened at seeing me, and flitted away
aacross the harbour towards the abbey.  When I came back from
the window  Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peace-
fullly.  She did not stir again all night.

     14 Augugust.--On the  East Cliff, reading and writing all
day.. Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot
as I am,  and   it is hard to get her away from it when it is
time tto come home  for  lunch or tea or dinner.  This after-
noon she made a  funny remark.We were coming home for dinner,
and had  come to  the top  of the steps up from the West Pier

and  stopped to look  at the view,  as we generally do.  The
setting suun, low down in the  sky, was just dropping  behind
Keettleness.  The red light was thrown over on the East Cliff
and  the  olld  abbey, and  seemed  to  bathe everything in a
beauutiful  rosy  glow.  We were  silent  for  a  while,  and
suddenly Lucy  murmured as if to herself . . .
      "His red eyes again!  They are  just the same."  It was
such an  odd   expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it
quitee startled  me.  I  slewed  round a little, so as to see
Lucy well withoout seeming to  stare at her, and saw that she
was  inn  a  half dreamy  state, with an odd look on her face
that I  could  not quite  make  out,  so I said nothing, but
followed  her eyes.  She appeared to be  looking over  at our
oown seat, whereon  was  a dark  figure seated  alone.  I was
quite a litttle startled myself, for it seemed for an instant
as  if the  stranger  had great eyes like burning flames, but
a second lookk  dispelled the illusion.  The red sunlight was
shiniing on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our seat,
and  as  the suun  dipped there was just sufficient change in
the reffraction  and  reflection  to make it appear as if the
light  moved.  I  called  Lucy's  attention to  the peculiar
effect, aand she became herself with a start, but  she looked
ssad all the same.  It may have been that  she  was  thinking
of that terrrible night up there.  We  never  refer to it, so
I ssaid nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a head-
ache and wentt early to bed.  I saw her asleep, and went  out
for aa little stroll myself.
     I walkeed along the cliffs to the westward, and was full
of ssweet sadness,for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming
home, it was tthen bright moonlight, so bright  that,  though
the frront of our part of the Crescent was  in shadow, every-
thing could be wwell seen, I threw a glance up at our window,
and  saww  Lucy's head leaning out.  I opened my handkerchief

and waved it.  She did not notice or make any movement what-
ever.  Jusst then, the moonlight crept round an angle of  the
buuilding, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly
was Lucy witth her head lying up against the side of the win-
dow  sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her,
seated on the  window sill, was something that  looked like a
good-ssized bird.  I was afraid she  might get a chill, so  I
ran upstairs,butt as I came into the room she was moving back
to her bbed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily.She was hold-

ing her hand to her throat, as though to protect if from the
cold.
       I  did  not wake her, but tucked her up warmly.  I have
taken care  tthat the  door is locked and the window securely
fasteened.
     She loooks so sweet as she sleeps, but she is paler than
is hher wont, and there is a drawn,  haggard look  under  her
eyes which I ddo not like. I fear she is fretting about some-
thing..  I wish I could find out what it is.

     15 Augusust.--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and
tiredd, and slept on after we had been called. We had a happy
surprise at breeakfast.  Arthur's father is better, and wants
the marrriage to come off soon.  Lucy is full  of  quiet joy,
and her mother is glad and sorry at once.Later on in the day
she told  me the cause.  She is grieved to  lose  Lucy as her
vvery own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to  have some
one to prottect her.  Poor dear, sweet lady!  She confided to
me  that she has got her death warrant.She has not told Lucy,
and made me ppromise secrecy. Her doctor told her that within
a feww months, at most, she  must die, for her heart is weak-
ening. At any ttime, even now, a sudden shock would be almost
sure too kill her.Ah,we were wise to keep from her the affair
of the dreadful night of Lucy's sleep-walking.

       17 August.--No  diary  for  two whole days.  I have not
had the heartt to write.  Some sort  of shadowy pall seems to
be  ccoming over  our  happiness.  No news from Jonathan, and
Lucy seems  to   be growing weaker, whilst her mother's hours
are nummbering to a close.  I do not understand Lucy's fading
away  as  she  is doing.  She eats well and sleeps well, and
enjoys thhe  fresh air,  but  all  the  time the roses in her
ccheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid  day
by day.  Att night I hear her gasping as if for air.
     I keep  the key of our door always fastened to my  wrist
at nnight, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits
at the open wiindow.  Last night I found her leaning out when
I wokee up, and when I tried to wake her I could not.
     SShe was in a faint.  When I managed to restore her, she
was weak as wateer, and cried silently between long,  painful
strugglees for breath.  When I asked her how she  came  to be

at the window she shook her head and turned away.
      I  trust  her  feeling ill may not be from that unlucky
prick of the  safety-pin.  I looked at her throat just now as
she llay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
They are still  open, and, if anything, larger  than  before,
and thee edges of them are faintly white.They are like little
white dots with red centres.  Unless  they heal within a day
or two, II shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.

       MINA MURRRAY'S JOURNAL.

 
     18 August.--I  am happy today, and write sitting on the
seat in thee  churchyard.  Lucy is ever so much better.  Last
nigght she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once.
     The rosees seem coming back already to her cheeks,though
she iis still sadly pale and wan-looking.  If she were in any
way anemic I coould understand it, but she is not.  She is in
gay spiirits and full of life and cheerfulness.All the morbid
reticence seems to have passed from her, and  she  has  just
reminded  me, as if I needed any reminding, of that night,and
tthat it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep.
     As  she  ttold  me she tapped playfully with the heel of
her booot on the stone slab and said,
      "My  poor  little  feet didn't make much noise then!  I
daresay poor  oold  Mr. Swales would have told me that it was
becausee I didn't want to wake up Geordie."
     As she was in such  a communicative humour, I asked her
if she haad dreamed at all that night.
     BBefore she answered,that sweet, puckered look came into
her forehead, whhich Arthur,I call him Arthur from her habit,
says he  loves, and indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then

she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way,  as if trying to
recall it  to herself.
      "I didn't quite dream, but it all seemed to be real.  I
only wanted to  be here in this spot. I don't know why, for I
was afrraid  of  something,  I  don't know what.  I remember,
though I  suppose  I was asleep, passing through the streets
and over  the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I lean-
eed over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling.The
whole  townn seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling
at  once, as I  went up the steps.  Then I had a vague memory
of something   long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in
the   sunset, and  something  very  sweet and very bitter all
around me at onnce. And then I seemed sinking into deep green
water,  and  there was  a singing in my ears, as I have heard
there is to drowning men, and then everything seemed passing
away fromm  me.  My  soul seemed  to  go out from my body and
ffloat about the air.  I seem to  remember that once the West
Lighthouse  was right under  me, and then there was a sort of
agoonizing feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came
back and founnd  you shaking my body.  I saw you do it before
I fellt you."
     Thenn she began to laugh.  It seemed a little uncanny to
mme, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like
it,and thouught it better not to keep her mind on the subject,
soo we  drifted on to another subject, and Lucy was like  her
old self agaain. When we got home the fresh breeze had braced
her  up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy.Her mother
rejoiced when  she saw her, and we  all  spent  a  very happy
eveninng together.

       19 August.--Joy,  joy,  joy!  Although not all joy.  At
last, news off Jonathan.  The dear  fellow has been ill, that
is whhy he did  not write.  I am not afraid to think it or to
say it, now thaat I know.  Mr. Hawkins sent me on the letter,
and wroote himself, oh so kindly.  I am to leave in the morn-
ing  and  go  over to Jonathan, and  to help to nurse him if
necessaryy, and to bring him home.  Mr. Hawkins says it would
nnot be  a  bad thing  if we were to be married out there.  I
have cried  over the good  Sister's letter till I can feel it
wett against my bosom, where it lies.  It is of Jonathan, and
must be near  my heart, for he is in my heart.  My journey is
all mmapped out, and  my luggage ready.  I am only taking one
change of dresss. Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep
it tilll I send for it, for it may be that . . . I must write
no more.  I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband. The
letter thhat he has seen and  touched must comfort me till we
mmeet.

 LETTER, S SISTER AGATHA, HOSPITAL OF ST. JOSEPH AND STE. MARY
    BUDA-PESTH, TO MISS WILLHELMINA MURRAY

12 August,t,

"Dear Madam.
 
     "I write  by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is him-
self  not   strong enough  to write, though progressing well,
thaanks to God  and  St. Joseph  and Ste. Mary.  He  has been
under our carre for nearly six weeks, suffering from  a  vio-
lent  brain fever.  He wishes me to convey his  love, and  to
say that by thiis post I write for him to  Mr. Peter Hawkins,
Exeter,, to say, with his dutiful respects, that  he is sorry
for his delay, and that all of his work is completed.He will
require ssome few weeks' rest in our sanatorium in the hills,
bbut will then return.  He wishes me to say that he  has  not
sufficient  money with him, and that he would like to pay for
hiss staying here,so that others who need shall not be  want-
ing for belp..
         Believee me,
         Youurs, with sympathy
         and all blessings.
   Sisster Agatha"

       "P.S.--My patient being asleep, I  open this to let you
know somethinng more.  He has told me all about you, and that
you aare shortly to be his wife.  All  blessings to you both!
He has had somee fearful shock,so says our doctor, and in his
deliriuum his ravings have been dreadful,of wolves and poison
and blood, of ghosts and demons, and I  fear to say of what.
Be carefuul of him always that there may be nothing to excite
hhim of this kind for a long time to come. The traces of such
an illness  as his do not lightly die away.  We  should  have
wriitten long ago, but we knew nothing of  his  friends,  and
there  was  nnothing on him, nothing that anyone could under-
standd.  He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
was told by thee station master there that he rushed into the
stationn  shouting  for  a  ticket for home.  Seeing from his
violent demeanor that he was English, they gave him a ticket
for the   furthest  station on the way thither that the train
rreached.
     "Be  assured that he is well cared for.   He has won all
hhearts by his sweetness and gentleness.  He is truly getting
on well, annd I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all him-
sellf.  But be careful of him for safety's sake.  There are,I
pray God and  St.Joseph and Ste.Mary, many, many, happy years
for yyou both."

DR. S SEWARD'S DIARY

 
     19 Agust.--Strange  and  sudden change in Renfield last
night. Abouut eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff
aboout as  a dog does when setting.  The attendant was struck
by  his  mannner,  and knowing my interest in him, encouraged
him tto talk.  He is  usually respectful to the attendant and
at  times  servvile,  but  tonight,  the man tells me, he was
quite hhaughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all.
     All he would say was, "I don't want to talk to you. You
don't couunt now.  The master is at hand."
      The  attendant  thinks it is some sudden form of relig-
ious mania wwhich has seized him. If so, we must look out for
squaalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania
at once might  be dangerous.The combination is a dreadful one.
      At Nine o'clock I visited him myself.His attitude to me
was the same ass that to the attendant.  In his sublime self-
feelingg the  difference  between  myself  and  the attendant
seemed to him as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and
he will ssoon think that he himself is God.
      These  infinitesimal  distinctions  between man and man
are too palltry for an Omnipotent Being.How these madmen give
theemselves  away!   The real  God taketh heed lest a sparrow
fall.  But thhe God created from human vanity sees no differ-
ence  between an eagle and a sparrow.  Oh,  if men only knew!
     For half aan hour or more Renfield kept  getting excited
in greaater and greater degree.I did not pretend to be watch-
ing him, but I kept strict observation all the same.  All at
once thatt shifty look came into his eyes which we always see
wwhen a  madman  has  seized  an idea, and with it the shifty
movement off  the head and  back which asylum attendants come
to  know so well.  He became quite quiet, and went and sat on
the edge of hhis bed  resignedly,  and looked into space with
lack--luster eyes.
      I thought  I  would find out if his apathy were real or
only  assumed,, and  tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a
theme  which had never failed to excite his attention.
      At  first he made no reply, but at length said testily,
"Bother them alll!  I don't care a pin about them."
     "What"  I said.  "You  don't mean  to tell me you don't
care abouut spiders?"  (Spiders  at present are his hobby and
tthe notebook is filling up with columns of small figures.)
     To this  he answered  enigmatically,  "The Bride maidens
rejoiice the  eyes  that  wait  the coming of the bride.  But
when the bride  draweth nigh, then  the  maidens shine not to
the eyees that are filled."
     He would nnot explain himself,  but remained obstinately
seated  on his bed all the time I remained with him.
     I aam  weary  tonight  and low in spirits.  I cannot but

think of Lucy, and how different things might have been.  If
I don't slleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus!  I must
bee careful not to let it grow into a habit. No, I shall take
none tonightt!  I have thought of Lucy, and I  shall not dis-
honoour her by mixing the two.  If need by,  tonight shall be
sleepless.



     Later.--Glad I made the resolution, gladder that I kept
to it.  I   had  lain  tossing about, and had heard the clock
sttrike only twice, when  the night watchman came to me, sent
up from the  ward, to say that Renfield had escaped.  I threw
on mmy clothes and ran down  at once.  My patient is too dan-
gerous a  persson  to  be  roaming about.  Those ideas of his
might  work out dangerously with strangers.
     The attendaant was  waiting for me.  He said he had seen
him not  ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed,when

he had looked through the observation trap in the door.  His
attention  was called by the sound of the window being wrench-
eed out.  He ran back and saw his feet disappear through  the
window, andd had at once sent up for me.  He was only  in his
nigght gear, and cannot be far off.
      The  attendant thought it would be more useful to watch
where he shouuld go than to follow him,as he might lose sight
of hiim whilst getting out of the building by the door. He is
a bulky man, annd couldn't get through the window.

     I am thin,  so, with his aid, I got out, but feet fore-
most,  andd  as we  were  only a few feet above ground landed
unnhurt.
     The atttendant told me the patient had gone to the left,
andd had taken a straight line, so  I  ran  as  quickly as  I
could.  As  II  got  through  the belt of trees I saw a white
figurre scale the  high wall which separates our grounds from
those of the deeserted house.
      I ran  back  at once, told the watchman to get three or
four men immeediately and  follow me into the grounds of Car-
fax,  in case our friend might  be dangerous.  I got a ladder
myself, and croossing the wall,dropped down on the other side.
I coulld see Renfield's figure just disappearing  behind  the
angle of the houuse, so I ran after him.  On the far  side of
the  houuse  I  found him pressed close against the old iron-

bound oak door of the chapel.
      He was talking, apparently to some one,but I was afraid
to go near enouugh to hear what he was saying,  les t I might
frighteen him, and he should run off.
      Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following
a naked lunaticc, when the fit of escaping is upon him! After
a few mminutes, however,I could see that he did not take note
of anything  around  him,  and so ventured to draw nearer to
him, the  more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were
cclosing him in.  I heard him say . . .
     "I am heree to do your bidding, Master. I am your slave,
and  yoou  will reward  me,  for I shall be faithful.  I have
worshipped you long and afar off.  Now that  you are near, I
await youur commands, and you will not pass me by,  will you,
ddear Master, in your distribution of good things?"
      He is a selfish old  beggar anyhow.  He  thinks of  the
loaves  and   fishes  even  when he believes his is in a real
Preseence.  His manias make a startling combination.  When we
closed in on hiim he fought like a  tiger.  He  is  immensely
strong,, for he was more like a wild beast than a man.
     II never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before,
and I hope I shhall not again.  It is a mercy  that  we  have
found oout his strength and  his  danger in  good time.  With
strength and determination like his, he might have done wild
work befoore he was caged.

     He  is  safe now,  at any  rate.  Jack Sheppard himself
couldn't gget free from the strait  waistcoat  that keeps him
reestrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded room.
     His  crries are  at  times  awful, but the silences that
folllow are more deadly still, for  he  means murder in every
turn and movemment.
     Just noow he spoke coherent words for the first time. "I
shalll be patient, Master.  It is coming, coming, coming!"
     So I took the hint, and came too.  I was too excited to
sleep, buut this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get
ssome sleep tonight.

         LETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA

                                        Buda-Pesth, 24 August.

"My dearest t Lucy,
     "I knoow you  will be anxious to hear all that has happ-
eneed since we parted at the railway station at Whitby.
       "Well,  my  dear, I got to Hull  all right, and caught
the boat too  Hamburg, and then  the train  on here.  I  feel
thaat I can  hardly  recall  anything of  the journey, except
that I knew II  was  coming to Jonathan, and that as I should
have   to do  some nursing, I had better get  all the sleep I
could.  I foundd my dear one, oh, so  thin and pale and weak-
lookingg.  All the  resolution has gone out of his dear eyes,
and that quiet dignity which I  told you was in his face has
vanished..  He  is only a  wreck  of himself, and he does not
rremember anything that  has happened  to him for a long time
past.  At   least, he  wants me  to  believe  so, and I shall
nevver ask.
     "He  has had  some  terrible shock, and  I fear it might
ttax his poor brain if he  were to  try to recall it.  Sister
Agatha, whoo  is a good creature  and  a born nurse, tells me
thaat he wanted her to tell me what they  were, but she would
only cross heerself, and say she  would never tell.  That the
ravinngs of  the  sick were the secrets of God, and that if a
nurse through hher  vocation should hear them, she should re-
spect hher trust..
     ""She is a  sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she
saw I was troublled, she opened  up the  subject my poor dear
raved abbout,  added,  `I  can tell  you this  much, my dear.

That it was not about anything which  he has done wrong him-
self, and  you, as his  wife  to be, have no cause to be con-
ceerned.  He  has not  forgotten  you or what he owes to you.
His fear wass of great and  terrible  things, which no mortal
can  treat of.'
     ""I do believe the  dear soul thought I might be jealous
lest my poor deaar should have  fallen in love with any other
girl. Thhe idea of my being jealous about Jonathan!  And yet,

my  dear,  let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me
when I kneew  that no other woman was a cause for trouble.  I
amm now sitting by his bedside,where I can see his face while
he sleeps.   He is waking!
      "When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to
get somethingg from the  pocket.  I asked  Sister Agatha, and
she bbrought all his things. I saw amongst them was his note-
book, and was wwas going to ask him to let me look at it, for
I knew  that I might find some clue to his trouble,but I sup-
pose he must have seen my  wish  in my eyes, for  he sent me
over to tthe window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a
mmoment.
     "Thenn he called me back,and he said to me very solemnly,
``Wilhelmina', I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for
he  has  neever  called  me by that name since he asked me to
marrry him,  `You know,  dear, my  ideas of the trust between
husband and wwife. There should be no secret, no concealment.
I havve had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it
is I  feel  my  head  spin round, and I do not know if it was
real off the dreaming of a madman.You know I had brain fever,
and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want
to know iit.  I want to take up my life here, with our marri-
aage.'  For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as
the formaliities are complete.  `Are you willing, Wilhelmina,
to  share my ignorance?  Here  is the book.  Take it and keep
it,read it iff you will,but never let me know unless, indeed,
some   solemn  duty  should come upon me to  go  back to  the
bitter  hours,  asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.'
He felll back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow,
and kissed him.   have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Super-
ior to leet our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her
rreply . . ."

       "She has come  and told me that the Chaplain of the En-
glish missionn church has been sent for. We are to be married
in ann hour, or as soon after as Jonathan awakes."

     " "Lucy, the time has come and gone.  I feel very solemn,
but very, very hhappy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour,
and all  was ready,  and  he sat  up in  bed, propped up with

pillows.   He answered  his  `I will' firmly  and strong.  I
could harddly speak.  My  heart  was so full that even  those
woords seemed to choke me.
     "The   dear  sisters were so kind.  Please, God, I shall
nevver,  never forget them, nor the grave   and sweet respon-
sibilities  II  have  taken  upon  me.  I must tell you of my
weddiing present.  When the chaplain and the sisters had left
me  alone  withh my husband--oh, Lucy, it is the first time I
have wrritten  the  words `my husband'--left me alone with my
husband, I took the  book from under his pillow, and wrapped
it  up inn white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale
bblue ribbon which was round  my neck, and sealed it over the
knot with   sealing  wax,  and for  my seal I used my wedding
rinng. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told
him that I woould keep it so, and then it would be an outward
and   visible sign  for us all our lives that we trusted each
other, that I wwould never open it unless it were for his own
dear saake or for the sake of some stern duty.  Then he  took
my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was  the first time he took
his wifess' hand, and said that it was the dearest  thing  in
aall the wide world,and that he would go through all the past
again to wiin it, if need be.The poor dear meant to have said
a ppart  of the  past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I
shall not wonnder if at first he mixes up not only the month,
but tthe year.
     "Weell, my dear, could I say? I could only tell him that

I was the happiest woman in all the  wide world, and that  I
had nothinng to give him except myself, my life,and my trust,
annd that with these went my love  and duty for all  the days
of my life.   And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to
him  with his poor weak hands, it was  like a  solemn  pledge
between us.


     "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?  It is
not only  because it is all sweet to me, but because you have
bbeen, and  are, very dear to  me.  It was my privilege to be
your friendd and guide when you came  from  the schoolroom to
preepare for the world of life.  I want  you to  see now, and
with the eyess of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me,
so thhat in your own married life you  too may  be all happy,
as I am.  My deear, please Almighty God, your life may be all
it prommises, a  long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no
forgetting  duty, no distrust.  I must not wish you no pain,
for  thatt can never be,  but I do hope you will be always as
hhappy as I am now.  Goodbye, my  dear.  I shall post this at
once, and   perhaps, write you very soon again.  I must stop,
forr Jonathan is waking.  I must attend my husband!

"My d dearest Mina,
      "Oceans  of  love  and  millions of kisses, and may you
soon be in youur own home with your husband.  I wish you were
comingg home soon enough to stay with us here. The strong air
would soon restoore Jonathan.  It has quite  restored  me.  I
have an  appetite like a cormorant, am full of life,and sleep

well.  You will be glad to know that I  have quite given  up
walking inn my sleep.  I think I have not  stirred out  of my
beed  for  a week, that is  when I once got into it at night.
Arthur says  I am getting fat.  By the way, I  forgot to tell
you  that Arthur is here.  We have such walks and drives, and
rides, and rowwing, and tennis,  and  fishing together, and I
love hhim more than ever.  He tells me that he loves me more,
but I doubt thatt, for at first  he told  me that he couldn't
love me  more than he did then.  But this is nonsense.  There

he is, calling to me.  So  no more just at present from your
loving,

 DR. S SEWARDS DIARY

       20 August.--The  case  of Renfield grows  even more in-
teresting.   He has now so far quieted that  there are spells
of ccessation from his passion.  For the first week after his
attack he was  perpetually violent.  Then  one night, just as
the mooon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself.
"Now I can wait..  Now I can wait."
     The attendaant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to
have a llook at  him.  He  was  still in the strait waistcoat

and in the padded room, but the  suffused look had gone from
his  face,, and his eyes had something of their old pleading.
I   might almost  say,  cringing,  softness.  I was satisfied
with his preesent condition, and directed him to be relieved.
The  attendants hesitated, but  finally carried out my wishes
without protesst.
     It  was   a  strange  thing  that the patient had humour
enoughh to see  their  distrust, for,  coming close to me, he
said in a whispeer, all the  while looking furtively at them,
"They thhink I could hurt you!   Fancy  me hurting  you!  The

fools!"
     It   was  soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find my-
sself disassociated even in the mind of this poor madman from
the others,, but all the same I do not follow his thought. Am
I tto take it that I have anything in common with him,so that
we are, as itt were, to stand together.Or has he to gain from
me soome good so stupendous that my well being is  needful to
Him?  I must fiind out later on.  Tonight he will not  speak.
Even thhe offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not
tempt him.
      He  will only say, "I  don't take  any stock in cats. I
have more to thhink of now, and I can wait.  I can wait."
     After  a while I left him.  The  attendant tells me that
he  was quiet until just before dawn, and  that then he began
to get uneasyy, and at length violent, until  at last he fell
into  a paroxysm which exhausted him so  that he swooned into
a sort of coma..

     . . . Thrhree nights has the same thing happened, violent
all daay then quiet from moonrise to sunrise.  I wish I could
get some clue too the cause. It would almost seem as if there
was somee influence which came and  went.  Happy thought!  We

shall tonight play sane wits  against mad  ones.  He escaped
before witthout our help.  Tonight  he shall escape  with it.
Wee shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow
in case theyy are required.


     23 August.--"The  expected  always  happens."  How well
Disraeli kknew life.  Our  bird  when he  found the cage open
woould not fly,so all our subtle arrangements were for nought.
At  any  raate, we have  proved one thing, that the spells of
quiietness last a reasonable time. We shall in future be able
to  ease his   bonds for  a few hours each day.  I have given
orderrs to the night attendant merely to shut him in the pad-
ded  room, whenn once he is quiet, until the hour before sun-
rise. TThe poor soul's body will enjoy the relief even if his
mind cannot appreciate  it.  Hark!  The unexpected again!  I
am calledd.  The patient has once more escaped.

     Later.----Another night adventure.Renfield artfully wait-
ed  uuntil the  attendant  was  entering the room to inspect.
Then  he dashedd  out past him and  flew down the passage.  I
sent woord  for the attendants to follow.  Again he went into
the  grounds  of the deserted house, and we found him in the
same placce, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw
mme he became  furious, and had not the attendants seized him
in time, hee would have tried to kill me.  As we sere holding
himm a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his eff-
orts, and theen as suddenly grew calm.I looked round instinc-
tivelly, but could see  nothing.  Then I caught the patient's
eye and followeed it, but  could trace nothing as  it  looked
into thhe moonlight sky, except a big bat, which was flapping
its  silent and ghostly way to the west.  Bats usually wheel
about, buut this one  seemed to go straight on, as if it knew
wwhere it was bound for or had some intention of its own.
     The  patieent grew  calmer  every instant, and presently
said,   "You needn't  tie  me.  I shall go quietly!"  Without
trouble, we came back to the house.  I feel  there  is some-
thing omiinous in his calm, and shall not forget this night.


       LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY

       Hillingham, 24 August.--I  must  imitate Mina, and keep
writing thingss down.  Then we can have long talks when we do
meet.   I wonder when it will be.  I  wish she  were with  me
again, for I feeel so unhappy.  Last night  I  seemed  to  be
dreamingg again just as I was at Whitby.  Perhaps  it is  the

change of air, or getting home again.  It  is  all dark  and
horrid to  me, for I can remember nothing.  But I am  full of
vaague fear, and I  feel so weak and  worn out.   When Arthur
came to luncch he looked quite grieved when he saw  me, and I
hadnn't the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder if I could
sleep in motheer's room tonight.I shall make an excuse to try.

       25 August.--Another  bad  night. Mother did not seem to
take  to  my  proposal.  She seems not  too well herself, and
doubttless she fears to worry me.  I tried to keep awake, and
succeeded for aa while, but  when  the clock struck twelve it
waked mme  from  a  doze, so I must have been falling asleep.
There  was  a sort  of scratching or flapping at the window,
but I didd  not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose
II must have fallen asleep.  More bad dreams.  I wish I could
remember thhem.  This morning I am horribly weak.  My face is
ghaastly pale, and my throat  pains me.  It must be something
wrong  with   my  lungs,  for I  don't seem to be getting air
enouggh.  I  shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else
I know he will  be miserable to see me so.

"My dearr Jack,
     "I waant you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill, that is she
haas no special disease, but  she looks awful, and is getting
worse every  day.  I have  asked her if there is any cause, I
not  dare to ask her  mother, for  to disturb the poor lady's
mind about herr daughter in her present state of health would
be fattal.  Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is
spoken, disease  of the heart, though poor Lucy does not know
it yet.  I am sure that there is something preying on my dear

girl's mind. I am almost distracted when I think of her.  To
look at heer gives me a pang.  I told her I should ask you to
seee her, and  though she  demurred at first, I know why, old
fellow, she  finally consented. It will be a painful task for
you,, I know, old friend, but it is for  her sake, and I must
not hesitate tto ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch
at Hilllingham tomorrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any
suspicion in Mrss. Westenra,and after lunch Lucy will take an
opportunnity  of  being  alone  with you.  I am  filled  with

anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I can
after you  have seen her.  Do not fail!

 LETTER F FROM DR. SEWARD TO ARTHUR HOLMWOOD


         2 September

"My dear olold fellow,
     "WWith regard to Miss Westenra's  health I hasten to let
you know at once that in  my opinion there is not any funct-
al  distuurbance or  any  malady that I know of.  At the same
ttime, I am  not by any  means satisfied with her appearance.
She is woeffully different from what  she  was when I saw her
lasst.  Of  course you must  bear in mind that I did not have
full opportunnity of examination such  as I should wish.  Our
very   friendship makes  a little  difficulty which  not even
medical sciencee or custom can bridge over. I had better tell
you exaactly what happened,leaving you to draw, in a measure,
your own conclusions.  I shall then say what I have done and
propose ddoing.
     "I fouund  Miss Westenra in  seemingly gay spirits.  Her
motther was  present, and in a  few seconds I made up my mind
that  she  waas trying all she knew to mislead her mother and
preveent her from being anxious. I have no doubt she guesses,
if she does nott know, what need of caution there is.
     "We  lunchhed  alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to
be cheeerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours,
some real  cheerfulness amongst us.  Then Mrs. Westenra went
to  lie   down,  and Lucy was left with me.  We went into her
bboudoir, and till we  got there her gaiety remained, for the
servants weere coming and going.
     "As soon  as the door was closed, however, the mask fell
from hher face, and  she  sank down into a chair with a great
sigh, and  hid hher  eyes with her hand.  When I saw that her
high spiirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her re-

action to make a diagnosis.
     "SShe said to me very sweetly,  `I cannot tell you how I
loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her that a doctor's
confidencce was sacred, but that you  were grievously anxious
aabout her.  She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled
that matterr in a word. `Tell Arthur everything you choose. I
do  not care for myself, but for him!'  So I am quite free.
     "I could eeasily see that she was somewhat bloodless,but
I couldd not see the usual anemic signs, and by the chance ,I
was able to test the actual  quality  of her  blood, for  in
opening aa window which was stiff a cord gave way,and she cut
hher hand slightly with broken glass.  It was a slight matter
in itself,  but it gave me an evident chance, and  I  secured
a ffew drops of the blood and have analysed them.
     "TThe qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition,
and shows, I shoould infer, in  itself a  vigorous  state  of
health.  In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that

there is  no  need for anxiety, but as there must be a cause
somewhere,, I have  come  to  the  conclusion that it must be
soomething mental.
      "She  complains of  difficulty breathing satisfactorily
at times, aand  of  heavy, lethargic sleep,  with dreams that
friighten  her, but regarding which she can remember nothing.
She says thatt as a child, she used to walk in her sleep, and
that   when  in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she
walked  out in  the night and  went to East Cliff, where Miss
Murray  found her.  But she assures me that of late the habit
has not returned.
     "I am in dooubt,  and so have done the best thing I know
of.  I hhave  written to  my old friend and master, Professor

Van Helsing, of Amsterdam,  who knows  as much about obscure
diseases aas any one in  the world.  I have asked him to come
ovver,  and as you told me that all things were to be at your
charge, I  hhave mentioned to  him who you are and your rela-
tionns  to Miss Westenra.  This,  my dear fellow, is in obed-
ience to your   wishes, for I  am only too proud and happy to
do anyything I can for her.
     "Van  Hellsing  would,  I know, do anything for me for a
personnal reason, so no  matter  on what  ground he comes, we
must  accept  hiis  wishes.  He is a seemingly arbitrary man,
this is   because he  knows what he  is talking about  better

than any one else.  He is a philosopher and a metaphysician,
and one off  the most advanced  scientists of his day, and he
haas, I believe, an absolutely open mind.  This, with an iron
nerve,a tempper of the ice-brook, and indomitable resolution,
selff-command, and toleration  exalted from virtues to bless-
ings,  and thee kindliest  and truest heart that beats, these
form hhis equipment for the noble work  that he is  doing for
mankind, work booth in theory and practice, for his views are
as wide  as his all-embracing sympathy.I tell you these facts

that you may know why I have such confidence in him.  I have
asked him  to come at once.I shall see Miss Westenra tomorrow
aggain.  She is to meet me at  the Stores, so  that I may not
alarm her moother by too early a repetition of my call.
     "Yourrs always."

 LETTER, DRDR. SEWARD TO HON. ARTHUR HOLMWOOD


         3 September

"My dear Artrt,
     "Van Helsiing  has come and  gone. He came on with me to
Hillinggham, and found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother
was lunching out, so that we were alone with her.
      "Van Helsing made  a  very careful  examination  of the
patient.  Hee is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for
of ccourse I was not present all the time.   He is,  I  fear,
much concernedd, but says he must think.  When I  told him of
our frriendship and how you trust to me in the matter,he said,
`You must tell  him all you think. Tell him him what I think,
if you  can guess it, if you will.   Nay,  I  am not jesting.
This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.'  I asked
what he mmeant by that, for  he was  very  serious.  This was
wwhen we had come back to town,and he was having a cup of tea
before starrting on his return to Amsterdam.He would not give
me  any further clue. You must not be angry with me, Art, be-
cause his verry reticence means that all his brains are work-
ing ffor her good. He will speak plainly enough when the time
comes, be sure..So I told him I would simply write an account
of our  visit, just  as if I were doing a descriptive special
article for THE DAILY TELEGRAPH.He seemed not to notice, but
remarked  that the smuts of London were  not quite so  bad as
tthey used to be when he was a student here.  I am to get his
report tomoorrow if he can possibly make  it.  In any  case I
am  to have a letter.
     "Well, as to the  visit, Lucy was more cheerful than on
the day II first  saw her, and  certainly looked better.  She
hhad lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you,and
her breathiing was normal.She was very sweet to the Professor
(ass she always is),and tried to make him feel at ease,though
I could see tthe poor girl was making a hard struggle for it.
      "I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
look under his  bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began
to chatt of all things except ourselves and diseases and with
such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pre-
tense of  animation  merge into  reality.  Then,  without any
sseeming change, he brought  the conversation gently round to
his visit,  and sauvely said,
     "`My dear young miss, I  have the so great pleasure be-
cause youu are so much  beloved.  That is much, my dear, even
wwere there that which I  do  not see.  They told me you were
down in thee spirit, and that you were of a  ghastly pale. To
theem I say "Pouf!" '  And  he  snapped his fingers at me and
went on.  `Buut you and I shall show them how wrong they are.
How ccan he', and  he  pointed at  me with  the same look and
gesture as  thaat  with which he pointed me out in his class,
on,  orr rather  after, a  particular occasion which he never
fails to remind me of, `know anything of a young ladies?  He
has his mmadmen to play with,and to bring them back to happi-
nness,  and  to those that love them.  It is much to do, and,
oh, but theere are  rewards in that we can bestow such happi-
nesss.But the young ladies!  He has no wife nor daughter, and
the  young  ddo not tell  themselves to the young, but to the
old,  like me, who  have known so many sorrows and the causes
of them.So, my  dear, we will send him away to smoke the cig-
arette  in the garden, whiles you and  I have little talk all
to ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and pre-
sently thhe professor came to the window and called me in. He
llooked grave, but said, ` I have made  careful  examination,
but there iis no functional cause.With you I agree that there
hass been much blood  lost, it  has been but is not.  But the
conditions off her are in no way anemic.  I have asked her to
send   me her maid, that I may ask just one or two questions,
that so I may   not chance to miss nothing.  I know well what
she willl say.  And yet there is cause. There is always cause
for everything.  I must  go  back  home and think.  You must
send me tthe telegram every day,and if there be cause I shall
ccome again.  The  disease,  for not to be well is a disease,
interest mee, and the sweet, young dear, she interest me too.
Shee  charm me,  and for  her,  if not  for you or disease, I
come.'
       "As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when
we were alone.   And so  now,  Art,  you know all  I know.  I
shall kkeep stern watch.I trust your poor father is rallying.
It must be a terrible thing to you,my dear old fellow, to be
placed inn such a position between two people who are both so
ddear to you.  I know your idea of duty  to  your father, and
you are rigght to stick to it.  But if need be,  I shall send
youu word to come at once to Lucy, so do  not be over-anxious
unless you heear from me."

           DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

      4 4 September.--Zoophagous  patient  still keeps  up our
interest in him.  He had only one outburst and that was yes-
terday att an unusual time.  Just before  the stroke of  noon
hhe began to grow restless.  The attendant knew the symptoms,
and at oncee summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run,
andd were just in time,for at the stroke of noon he became so
violent that  it took all their strength to hold him.In about
five  minutes, however,he began to get more quiet,and finally
sank into a sorrt of melancholy,in which state he has remain-
ed up tto now. The attendant tells me that his screams whilst
in the paroxysm were really appalling. I found my hands full
when I goot in, attending to some  of the  other patients who
wwere frightened by him.  Indeed, I  can quite understand the
effect, forr  the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some
disstance away.It is now after the dinner hour of the asylum,
and as yet myy patient sits in a corner brooding,with a dull,
sulleen, woe-begone look in his face,  which  seems rather to
indicate  than   to show  something directly. I cannot  quite
understtand it.

     LaLater.--Another change  in my patient.  At five o'clock
I looked in on  him, and found  him seemingly  as  happy and
contentedd as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating
tthem,and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks
on the edgee of the door between the ridges of padding.  When
he  saw me, he came over and apologized for his  bad conduct,
and asked me  in a very humble, cringing way to be  led  back
to hiis own room, and to have his notebook again.I thought it
well to humour  him,so he is back in his room with the window
open.   He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the  window
sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is not now
eating thhem, but putting them into a box,  as of old, and is
aalready examining the corners of his room to find a spider.I
tried to geet him to talk  about the past few days,  for  any
cluue to his thoughts would be of  immense help to me, but he
would not risse.  For a moment or two he looked very sad, and
said  in a sort of far away voice, as though saying it rather
to himself thann to me.
     "Alll over!  All over!  He has deserted me.  No hope for
mme now unless I do it myself!"  Then  suddenly turning to me
in a resoluute way, he said,"Doctor,won't you be very good to
me  and let me have a little more sugar?  I think it would be
very good forr me."
     "And tthe flies?"  I said.
     "Yes!   Thhe  flies like  it, too, and I like the flies,
therefoore I like it."And there are people who know so little
as to think that madmen do not argue.I procured him a double
supply, aand left him as happy a man as,I suppose, any in the
wworld.  I wish I could fathom his mind.

     Midnighght.--Another change in him.I had been to see Miss
Westtenra, whom I  found much  better, and had just returned,
and was standiing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when
once mmore I heard him yelling.As his room is on this side of
the house, I  coould  hear it better than in the morning.  It
was a shhock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of

a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
and  all tthe marvellous  tints that come on foul clouds even
ass on foul water,and to realize all the grim sternness of my
own cold stoone building, with its wealth of breathing misery,
andd my  own  desolate heart to endure it all.  I reached him
just as the ssun was  going down, and from his window saw the
red ddisc sink.  As it sank he became less and less frenzied,
and just as  itt dipped he slid from the hands that held him,
an inerrt mass, on the floor.  It is wonderful, however, what
intellectual recuperative  power lunatics have, for within a
few minuttes he stood  up quite calmly and looked around him.
II  signalled  to the attendants not to  hold  him, for I was
anxious to  see what he would do.  He  went  straight over to
thee window  and  brushed  out the crumbs of  sugar.  Then he
took his fly  box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the
box.  Then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on
his bed.All thiis surprised me, so I asked him,"Are you going
to keepp flies any more?"
     "No,"  said  he.  "I am  sick of all that rubbish!"  He
certainlyy is a wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could
gget some glimpse of his mind or of  the cause of his  sudden
passion. Sttop. There may be a clue after all, if we can find
whyy today his paroxysms came on at high noon and  at sunset.
Can it be thaat there  is  a  malign  influence of the sun at
perioods which affects certain natures, as  at times the moon
does others?  WWe shall see.

"My deaear Art,
     "My nnews  today  is not so good.  Lucy this morning had
goone back a bit. There is, however, one good thing which has
arisen from  it. Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concern-
ing  Lucy, and has consulted me professionally  about her.  I
took advantagee of the opportunity, and told her that my  old
masterr, Van Helsing, the great specialist,was coming to stay
with me, and thaat I would put her in his  charge  conjointly
with mysself.  So now we can come and go without alarming her

unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death,and this,
in Lucy's  weak condition, might be disastrous to her. We are
heedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor fellow, but,
please God,  we shall come through them all right.If any need
I shhall write, so that, if you do not hear from  me, take it
for granted thhat I am simply waiting for news, In haste,
       "Yoours ever,"
        John Seward

    DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

     7 Septembmber.--The  first  thing Van Helsing  said to me
when wwe met at Liverpool Street was, "Have you said anything
to our young friiend, to lover of her?"
     "No," II said.  "I waited till I had seen you, as I said
in mmy telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling him that
you were cominng,as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I
shouldd let him know if need be."
     "Riight,  my friend," he said.  "Quite right!  Better he

not know as yet. Perhaps he will never know.  I pray so, but
if it be nneeded, then he shall know all. And, my good friend
Joohn, let me caution you.  You deal with the madmen. All men
are mad in ssome way or the other, and inasmuch as  you  deal
disccreetly with your madmen, so deal with  God's madmen too,
the rest of thhe world.  You tell not your madmen what you do
nor whhy you do it.  You tell  them not  what  you think.  So
you  shall  keepp  knowledge in its place, where it may rest,
where itt may gather its kind around it and breed.  You and I

shall keep as yet  what we know here, and here."  He touched
me on the  heart and  on the  forehead, and then touched him-
seelf the same way.  "I have for  myself thoughts at the pre-
sent.  Laterr I shall unfold to you."
     "Why  not now?"  I asked.  "It may do some good.  We may
arrrive at some decision."He looked at me and said,"My friend
John, when tthe corn is grown,  even before  it has  ripened,
whille the milk of its mother earth is  in him,  and the sun-
shine has not  yet begun to paint him with his gold, the hus-
bandmaan he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands,
and blow away thhe green chaff, and say  to you, 'Look!  He's
good corrn, he will make a good crop when the time comes.' "
      I did  not  see the application and  told  him so.  For
reply he reeached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled
it  playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures,and said,
"The good huusbandman tell you so then because he  knows, but
not  till then.  But you do not find the  good husbandman dig
up his plantedd corn  to see if he  grow.  That  is  for  the
childrren who play at husbandry, and  not for  those who take
it as of the worrk of their life.  See you now, friend  John?
I have ssown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making

it sprout, if he sprout at all, there's some promise, and  I
wait till  the ear begins to swell."  He  broke off,  for  he
evvidently saw  that  I understood.  Then he went on gravely,
"You were allways a careful  student, and your  case book was
everr more full  than  the rest.  And I trust that good habit
have not  faill.  Remember,  my  friend,  that  knowledge  is
strongger than memory,  and  we should  not trust the weaker.
Even if you havee not kept the good practice, let me tell you
that thiis case of our dear miss is one that may be, mind,  I

say may be, of such interest to us and others  that all  the
rest may nnot make him kick  the  beam,  as  your people say.
Taake then good note of it.  Nothing is too small.  I counsel
you, put dowwn in record even your doubts and surmises. Here-
afteer it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess.
We learn fromm failure, not from success!"
     WWhen  I  described Lucy's symptoms, the same as before,
but infinitely mmore  marked, he looked very grave, but said
nothing.   He took with him a bag in which were many instru-
meents  and  drugs,  "the ghastly paraphernalia of our bene-
ficial trade,," as  he  once called, in one of his lectures,
the eqquipment of a professor of the healing craft.
     Wheen we were shown in,  Mrs. Westenra met us.  She was
aalarmed, but not nearly so much as I  expected to find her.
Nature in onne of her  beneficient  moods  has ordained that
even  death has some antidote to its  own terrors.  Here, in
a case where anyy shock may prove fatal,matters are so order-
ed that,, from some cause or other, the things not personal,
eeven the terrible change in her daughter  to whom she is so
attached, doo not seem  to reach her.  It is  something like
the wway  dame  Nature gathers round a foreign body an enve-
lope of some inssensitive tissue which can protect from evil
that whicch it would  otherwise harm by contact.  If this be
ann ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we con-
demn any one  for the vice of egoism,for there may be deeper
root ffor its causes than we have knowledge of.
     I  usedd my knowledge of this phase of spiritual patho-
logy,, and set  down  a  rule that she should not be present
with Lucy, or thhink of her illness more than was absolutely
required.. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again
thhe hand of Nature fighting for life.Van Helsing and I were
shown up to LLucy's room.  If  I was  shocked when I saw her
yesterrday, I was horrified when I saw her today.
     She wwas ghastly, chalkily pale. The red seemed to have
gonne even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face
stood out promminently.  Her breathing was painful to see or
hear.   Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his  eye-

brows converged till they almost touched over his nose.Lucy
lay motionlless, and did not seem to have strength to speak,
so ffor a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckon-
ed to me, and wwe went gently out  of the room.  The instant
we had cclosed the door he stepped quickly along the passage
tto the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly
in with him  and closed the door.  "My god!" he said.  "This
is drreadful.  There  is not time to be  lost.  She will die
for  sheer want   of blood  to keep the heart's action as it
should bee. There must be a transfusion of blood at once. Is
itt you or me?"
      "I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me."
     "Then get  ready at once. I will bring up my bag.  I am
preparedd."
     I went doownstairs with him, and as we were going there
was a kknock at the hall door. When we reached the hall, the

maid  had  just  opened the  door, and  Arthur was stepping
quickly in.. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper,
      "Jack, I was so  anxious.  I read between the lines of
your letter, annd have been in an agony. The dad was better,
so I rann down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman
DDr.Van Helsing?  I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming."
     When fiirst the Professor's eye had lit upon him,he had
been  angry  at his interruption at such a time, but now, as
he  took  in  hiis  stalwart  proportions and recognized the
strong yooung manhood  which seemed to emanate from him, his
eyyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him as he held out
his hand,
       "Sir, you have come in time.  You are the lover of our
dear miss.  SShe is bad,  very, very bad.  Nay, my child, do
not goo like that."For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in
a chair almost fainting.  "You are to help her.  You can do
more than  any that live,and your courage is your best help."
      "What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely.  "Tell me, and
I shall  do iit.  My life is hers' and I would give the last
drop oof blood in my body for her."
     TThe Professor has a strongly humorous side,and I could
from old knowledge detect a  trace  of  its  origin  in his
answer.
 
     "My  young  sir, I do not ask so much as that, not the
last!"
       "What shall I do?" There was fire in his eyes, and his
open nostrils qquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him
on the sshoulder.
     "Coome!"   he said.  "You are a man, and it is a man we
wwant.  You are better than me, better than my friend John."
Arthur lookeed bewildered,  and the Professor went on by ex-
plainning in a kindly way.
     "Young miiss  is  bad,  very bad.  She wants blood, and
blood sshe must have or die.  My friend John and I have con-

sulted,and we are about to perform what we call transfusion
of  blood,  to transfer  from full veins of one to the empty
veinns which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he
is the more youung and strong than me."--Here Arthur took my
hand andd wrung it hard in silence.--"But  now you are here,
yyou are more good than us, old or young, who  toil much  in
the world off thought.  Our nerves are  not so calm and  our
bloodd so bright than yours!"
     Arthurr turned to him  and  said, "If you only knew how
gladdly I would die for her you would understand . . ."   He
stopped with a  sort of choke in his voice.
     "GGood boy!" said Van Helsing.   "In the not-so-far-off

you will  be happy that you have done all for her you love.
Come now annd be  silent.  You shall kiss her once before it
is   done,  but then  you must go,  and you must leave at my
sign.  Say no wword to Madame.  You know how it is with her.
There muust be no shock, any knowledge of this would be one.
CCome!"
     We alll went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction re-
mainned outside.  Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but
said nothing.   She was not asleep,  but she  was simply too
weak to  make the effort.Her eyes spoke to us, that was all.
      Van  Helsing  took  some things  from his bag and laid
them on a liittle table out  of sight.  Then he mixed a nar-
coticc,  and  coming  over to the bed, said cheerily,  "Now,
little miss, herre is your medicine.  Drink it  off,  like a
good chilld.  See, I  lift you  so  that to swallow is easy.
Yees."  She had made the effort with success.
     It asstonished me how long the drug took to act.  This,
in  fact, marked the extent of her weakness. The time seemed
endless until   sleep  began  to flicker in her eyelids.  At
last, hhowever, the  narcotic began to manifest its potency,

and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was sat-
isfied, he  called Arthur into  the room, and bade him strip
off  his coat.  Then he added, "You may take that one little
kiss whiles  I  bring  over the table.  Friend John, help to
me!"  Soo neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.
     VVan Helsing,  turning to me, said, "He is so young and
strong,  and  of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate
it."
       Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Hel-
sing performedd  the operation.  As the transfusion went on,
somethiing  like  life  seemed to  come back  to poor Lucy's

cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy  of his
face seemedd absolutely to shine.  After  a bit  I began  to
groww anxious, for the loss of blood  was telling on Arthur,
strong man as hhe was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible
strain LLucy's system must have undergone that what weakened
AArthur only partially restored her.

     But the Professor's face was set,and he stood watch in
hand, and wwith his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on
Arthhur.  I could hear my own heart beat. Presently, he said
in a soft voicee, "Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You
attend hhim.  I will look to her."
     Whenn all was over,I could see how much Arthur was weak-
eened.  I  dressed  the  wound and took his arm to bring him
away, when VVan Helsing spoke without turning round, the man
seemss to have eyes in the back of his head,"The brave lover,
I think, deservve another kiss, which he shall have present-
ly."  Annd as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted
tthe pillow to the patient's  head.  As he did so the narrow
black  velveet band which she seems always to wear round her
throaat, buckled  with an old diamond buckle which her lover
had given  her,  was  dragged a little up,  and showed a red
mark on hher throat.
     AArthur  did  not  notice it, but I could hear the deep
hiss  of  indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's ways
of betrayiing  emotion.  He  said nothing at the moment, but
turrned to me, saying, "Now take down our brave young lover,
give him of thhe port wine, and let him lie down a while. He
must thhen go home and rest,sleep much and eat much, that he

may be  recruited  of what he has so given to his love.  He
must not sttay here. Hold a moment! I may take it, sir, that
you  are anxious of result.  Then bring it with you, that in
all  ways  the  operation is successful.  You have saved her
life thiis time, and  you can go  home and rest easy in mind
tthat all that can  be is.  I shall tell her all when she is
well.  She   shall love  you none the less for what you have
done..   Goodbye."
      When  Arthur  had  gone I went back to the room.  Lucy
was  sleeping   gently, but  her  breathing was stronger.  I
could  ssee  the  counterpane move as her breast heaved.  By
tthe bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her  intently.  The
velvet band  again covered the red mark.  I asked  the  Pro-
fessoor in a whisper, "What  do you make of that mark on her
throat?"
     " "What do you make of it?"
     "I haave not examined it yet," I answered, and then and
theere proceeded to  loose the band.  Just over the external
jugular  vein   there were two punctures, not large, but not
wholesoome looking.  There was  no sign  of disease, but the

edges were white and worn looking,as if by some trituration.
It at oncee occurred to me that that this wound, or whatever
it  was,  might be the means of that manifest loss of blood.
But I abandoneed the idea as  soon as  it formed, for such a
thing ccould not be.  The whole bed would have been drenched

to a scarlet with the blood  which the girl must  have lost
to leave suuch a pallor as she had before the transfusion.
     ""Well?"  said Van Helsing.
     "Welll," said I.  "I can make nothing of it."
     The Proofessor stood up.  "I  must go back to Amsterdam
tonigght," he said  "There  are books and things there which
I want.  You  muust remain here all  night, and you must not
let your  sight pass from her."
     "Shall II have a nurse?"  I asked.
     "We  are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all
niight.  See that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs
her.You must  not sleep all the night.Later on we can sleep,
you annd I.  I shall  be back as soon as possible.  And then
we may begin."
      "May begin?"  I said.  "What on earth do you mean?"
     "We shall  see!" he answered, as he hurried out.He came
back a mmoment  later  and  put his head inside the door and
ssaid with a warning finger held up,  "Remember, she is your
charge.  If  you  leave  her, and harm befall, you shall not
sleepp easy hereafter!"

     DR. SEWARDD'S DIARY--CONTINUED

     8 Septemember.--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate
workedd itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally.She
looked a different being from what she had been  before the
operation..Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a
happpy  vivacity,  but I could see evidences of the absolute
prostration whhich she had undergone.  When I told Mrs.West-
enra thhat Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up

with her, she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her
daughter's   renewed strength  and excellent spirits.  I was
firmm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil.When
her maid had prrepared her for the night I came in,having in
the meanntime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside.
      She did not in any way make objection,but looked at me
gratefully whennever I caught her eye.After a long spell she
seemed   sinking  off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to
ppull herself together and shook it off.It was apparent that
she did not  want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once.
      "You do not want to sleep?"
     ""No.  I am afraid."
     "Afraid to  go to sleep!  Why so? It is the boon we all
crave forr."
     "Ah,not iif you were like me, if sleep was to you a pre-
sage oof horror!"
     ""A presage of horror!  What on earth do you mean?"
      "I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  And that is what is
so terrible.   All this weakness comes to me in sleep, until
I dreadd the very thought."
     "But,  my  dear girl, you may sleep tonight.  I am here
watchingg you, and I can promise  that nothing will happen."
      "Ah, I can trust you!" she said.
     I seized thhe opportunity, and said, "I promise that if
I see anyy evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once."
      "You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me.
Then I will ssleep!"  And almost at the word she gave a deep
sigh oof relief, and sank back, asleep.
      All night long I watched by her.She never stirred, but
slept on and  on in a deep, tranquil,  life-giving,  health-
givingg sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast
rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum.  There was
a smile onn her  face, and it was evident that no bad dreams
hadd come to disturb her peace of mind.
     In the early morning her maid came, and  I left her in
her care aand took myself back home, for I was anxious about
manny things.  I sent  a  short wire  to  Van Helsing and to
Arthur, tellinng  them of the excellent result of the opera-
tion.   My own  work, with its manifold arrears, took me all

day  to clear  off.  It was dark when I was able to inquire
about my  zzoophagous patient.  The report was good.  He had
beenn quite quiet for the  past day and  night.  A  telegram
came from Van HHelsing  at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner,
suggestiing that I should  be at  Hillingham  tonight, as it
mmight be well to be at hand, and stating that he  was leav-
ing by the nnight mail and would join  me early in the morn-
ing..

     9 Septembeer.--I  was  pretty tired and worn out when I
got to HHillingham.  For  two nights I had hardly had a wink
oof sleep, and my brain was  beginning to feel that numbness
which marks  cerebral exhaustion.  Lucy was up and in cheer-
ful sspirits. When she shook hands with me she looked sharp-
ly in my face annd said,
     "No  sitting  up tonight for you.  You are worn out.  I
amm quite well again.Indeed, I am, and if there is to be any
sitting up, iit is I who will sit up with you."
      I would not argue the point,but went and had my supper.
Lucy came wwith me, and, enlivened  by her charming presence,
I mmade an excellent meal,and had a couple of glasses of the
more than exceellent port.  Then  Lucy took me upstairs, and
showed  me a room next her own,where a cozy fire was burning.
     "Now," she said.  "You  must stay here.  I shall leave
this door  open and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for
I kknow  that  nothing would induce any of you doctors to go
to bed whilst  there is a patient above the  horizon.  If  I
want  aanything  I shall call out, and you can come to me at

once."
     I  coould  not but  acquiesce, for I was dog tired, and
couuld not have sat up had I tried.  So, on her renewing her
promise to calll me if she should want anything,I lay on the
sofa, aand forgot all about everything.

L
LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY

     9 Septetember.--I feel so happy tonight.  I have been so
miserrably  weak, that to be able to think and move about is
like  feeling  ssunshine after a long spell of east wind out
of a steeel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me.
II seem to feel his presence warm about me.  I suppose it is
that sicknesss  and weakness are selfish things and turn our
innerr  eyes  and sympathy  on  ourselves, whilst health and
strength  give llove rein, and in thought and feeling he can
wander whhere  he  wills.  I know where my thoughts are.  If
onnly Arthur knew!  My dear,  my dear, your ears must tingle
as you sleep,, as mine do waking.  Oh,  the blissful rest of
last nnight!  How  I slept,  with that dear, good Dr. Seward
watching me.  And tonight I shall not fear  to sleep, since
he is closse at hand and  within  call.  Thank everybody for
beiing so good to me.  Thank God!  Goodnight Arthur.

    DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

     10 Septemember.--I was conscious of the Professor's hand
on my hhead, and started awake all in a second.  That is one

of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.
     "And how iss our patient?"
      "Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I
answered.
       "Come, let us see," he said. And together we went into
the room.
       The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently,
whilst  Van  Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread,
over  to the bed.
      As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flood-
ed the room,I heeard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration,
and knowwing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart.

As  I  passed  over  he  moved back, and his exclamation of
horror,  "GGott in Himmel!"  needed  no enforcement from his
agonnized  face.  He raised his hand and pointed to the bed,
and his iron faace was drawn and ashen white.I felt my knees
begin too tremble.
     Thhere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy,

more horribly white and  wan-looking  than  ever.  Even the
lips were wwhite, and the gums  seemed to have shrunken back
fromm the teeth,as we sometimes see in a corpse after a pro-
longed illness..
     Van Helsingg raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the
instinct  of  his life and all the long years of habit stood
too him, and he put it down again softly.
     "Quick!"  he said.  "Bring the brandy."
      I  flew to  the dining room, and returned with the de-
canter. He wetteed the poor white lips with it, and together
we rubbedd palm and wrist and heart.  He felt her heart, and
affter a few moments of agonizing suspense said,
     "IIt is not too late.  It beats, though but feebly. All

our work is undone.  We must begin again. There is no young
Arthur heree now.  I have to call on you yourself this time,
frieend John." As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag, and
producing the iinstruments of transfusion.I had taken off my
coat andd rolled up my shirt sleeve.There was no possibility
oof an opiate just at present, and  no need of one.  and so,
without a mooment's delay, we began the operation.
     After a tiime, it did not seem a short time either, for
the draiining  away of one's  blood, no matter how willingly
iit be given, is  a terrible  feeling, Van Helsing held up a
warning fingger.  "Do not stir,"  he said.  "But I fear that
with   growing strength  she  may wake,  and that would make
danger, oh, so mmuch danger.  But I shall precaution take. I
shall givve hypodermic injection of morphia."   He proceeded
thhen, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent.
      The  effect on  Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed
to merge subtlyy  into  the  narcotic  sleep.  It was with a
feeling  of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of
ccolor steal back into  the pallid cheeks and lips.  No  man
knows, till  he experiences it, what it is  to feel his  own
lifebblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.
     The  Professor watched me critically.  "That will do,"
he said.   "Already?"  I  remonstrated.   "You took  a great
deaal more from Art." To which he smiled a sad sort of smile
as he replied,,
     "He is her  lover, her fiance. You have work, much work
to do forr her and for others, and the present will suffice.
      When we  stopped the  operation, he  attended to Lucy,
whilst I appllied digital pressure to my own incision.I laid
down,  while I waited his leisure to attend to me,for I felt
faint and a little sick.By and by he bound up my wound, and
sent me doownstairs to get a glass of wine for myself.  As I
wass leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered.
     "Mind, noothing must be said of this.If our young lover
should  turn up unexpected, as  before, no word to  him.  It

would at once  frighten  him and enjealous him, too.  There
must be nonne.  So!"
     Wheen I came back  he looked  at me carefully, and then
ssaid,  "You are  not much the worse.  Go into the room, and
lie on your  sofa, and rest awhile, then have much breakfast
and ccome here to me."

     I  followed  out his orders, for  I knew how right and
wise they   were.  I had  done my part, and now my next duty
was  to  keep up my strength.  I felt very  weak, and in the
weakness lost ssomething of the amazement at what had occur-
red.  I  fell asleep  on the sofa,  however,  wondering over
aand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement,
and how shee  could have been drained of so  much blood with
no ssign any where to show for it.  I think I must have con-
tinued my wondeer in my dreams, for,  sleeping and waking my
thoughtss always came  back  to the little  punctures in her
tthroat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges,
tiny though  they were.
     LLucy slept well into the day,and when she woke she was
fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the
day beforee.  When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for
a wwalk, leaving me in charge, with  strict injunctions that
I was not to lleave her for a moment. I could hear his voice
in the  hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.
     Lucy  chatted  with me freely, and seemed quite uncon-
scious  thhat  anything  had happened.  I  tried to keep her
amuused and interested.  When her mother came up to see her,
she did not seeem to notice any change whatever, but said to
me grattefully,
     "We  owe you so much, Dr.Seward, for all you have done,
buut you really must now take care not to overwork yourself.
You are lookiing pale yourself.  You  want  a  wife to nurse
and loook after you a bit, that you do!"  As she spoke, Lucy
turned crimson,though it was only momentarily, for her poor
wasted veiins could  not stand for long an unwonted drain to
thee  head.  The  reaction  came  in excessive pallor as she
turned imploriing eyes on me.  I smiled and nodded, and laid
my fingger on my lips.  With a sigh,  she sank back amid her

pillows.
    Van  Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and present-
lly said  to  me.  "Now you go home,  and eat much and drink
enough.  Makke yourself strong.  I stay  here tonight, and I
shalll sit up with little miss myself.  You and I must watch
the case, and wee must have none other to know. I have grave
reasons.   No, do not ask the.  Think what you will.  Do not
feear to think even the most not-improbable.  Goodnight."
     In the halll two of the maids came  to me, and asked if
they or eeither of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.They
immplored me to let  them, and when  I said  it was  Dr. Van
Helsing's wissh that either he or I should sit up,they asked
me quiite piteously to intercede with the`foreign gentleman'.
I was much touchhed by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
I am weakk at present, and perhaps  because it was on Lucy's
acccount, that their devotion  was manifested.  For over and
over  again   have I seen similar instances of woman's kind-
ness.   I  got back  here in time for a late dinner, went my
rounds,all well, and set this down whilst waiting for sleep.
It is comming.

     11 SeSeptember.--This  afternoon I went over to Hilling-
hamm.  Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much
better.  Shorttly  after I  had  arrived,  a big parcel from
abroad  came for the Professor.  He  opened it with much im-

pressment,assumed, of course, and showed  a great bundle of
white floweers.
     "These aare for you, Miss Lucy," he said.
      "For me?  Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"

     "Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are
medicines.""  Here Lucy made a wry face.  "Nay, but they are
not  to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need
not snub that sso charming nose, or I shall point  out to my
friend AArthur what woes he may have to  endure in seeing so
mmuch beauty that he so loves so much distort.Aha, my pretty
miss, that bbring the so nice nose all straight again.  This
is meedicinal, but you do not know how.  I  put him  in your
window, I make ppretty wreath, and hang him round your neck,
so you slleep well.  Oh, yes!  They, like the lotus  flower,
maake your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of
Lethe,and of  that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores
soughtt for in the Floridas, and find him all too late."
      Whilst he  was  speaking,  Lucy had been examining the
flowers and smmelling them.  Now she threw them down saying,
with haalf laughter, and half disgust,
      "Oh, Professor, I  believe you are only  putting  up a
joke on me.  Whhy, these flowers are only common garlic."
     To my  surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said  with all
his  sternness,  his iron jaw  set and  his  bushy  eyebrows
meeting,
       "No  trifling  with me!  I  never jest!  There is grim
purpose in what  I do, and I warn you that you do not thwart
me. Take  care, for the sake of others if not for your own."
Thhen seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went
on more  genttly, "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me.
I onlyy  do for  your  good, but there is much virtue to you
in those so common flowers.  See,  I  place  them myself in
your room..  I make myself the wreath that you are to  wear.
Butt hush!   No telling  to others  that make so inquisitive
questions.  Wee must  obey,  and  silence is a part of obed-
ience,  and obedience is to bring you  strong and  well into

loving arms that wait for you.  Now sit still a while. Come
with me, frriend John, and you shall help  me deck  the room
withh my garlic, which is all the war from Haarlem, where my
friend Vanderpoool raise  herb in his glass houses  all  the
year.  II had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have
bbeen here."
     WWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The
Professor's actions were certainly odd and  not to be found
in any phaarmacopeia that I ever heard of.  First he fasten-
ed  up the windows and latched them  securely.  Next, taking
a handful of tthe flowers,he rubbed them all over the sashes,
as thoough to ensure that every whiff of air that might  get
in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp
he rubbed  all over the jamb of the door, above,  below, and
at  each side, and round the fireplace in the  same way.  It
all seemed grootesque to me, and presently  I  said,  "Well,
Professsor, I know you always have a reason for what you do,

but this certainly puzzles me.  It is well we have no scep-
tic here, oor he would say that you were  working some spell
to kkeep out an evil spirit."
     "Perhhaps  I  am!"  He answered  quietly as he began to
makke the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.
      We  then  waited  whilst  Lucy made her toilet for the
night, and   when  she was  in bed he came and himself fixed
the wwreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said
to her were,
       "Take care you do not disturb it, and even if the room
feel close, ddo not tonight open the window or the door."
     "I ppromise," said Lucy. "And thank you both a thousand
tiimes for all your kindness to me!  Oh, what have I done to
be blessed wiith such friends?"
     As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van
Helsing saaid,"Tonight I can sleep in peace,and sleep I want,
twwo nights of travel, much reading in the  day between, and
much anxiety  on the day to follow, and  a  night to sit up,
withouut to wink. Tomorrow in the morning early you call for
me,  and  we come together  to see our pretty miss, so much
more stronng for my `spell' which I have work.  Ho, ho!"
     Hee seemed so confident that I, remembering my own con-

fidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt
awe and vaggue terror.  It must  have  been my weakness that
madee me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all
the more, like  unshed tears.



CHAPTER 11

                     LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY

     12 Septetember.--How  good  they  all are to me.  I quite
love  that dear  Dr. Van Helsing.  I  wonder  why  he was  so
anxious  about  these  flowers.  He positively frightened me,
he was  so fierce.  And  yet  he must have  been right, for I
feel  comfort  from  them already.  Somehow, I  do not dread
being aloone  tonight, and I  can go to sleep without fear. I
sshall  not mind  any  flapping  outside the window.  Oh, the
terrible sttruggle that I have had  against sleep so often of
latte, the pain of sleeplessness, or the pain  of the fear of
sleep, and wiith such unknown horrors as it  has for me!  How
blesssed are some people, whose lives have no fears,no dreads,
to whom sleep  is a blessing that comes  nightly, and  brings
nothinng but sweet dreams.Well, here I am tonight, hoping for
sleep, and lyingg like Ophelia in the play,with`virgin crants
and maidden strewments.' I never liked garlic before, but to-

night it is delightful!  There is peace in its smell. I feel
sleep comiing already.  Goodnight, everybody.


DR. SEWARD'S DIAARY

     13 Septptember.--Called  at  the  Berkeley  and found Van
Helssing, as usual, up to  time.  The carriage  ordered  from
the hotel was  waiting.  The Professor took his bag, which he
alwayss brings with him now.
     Let all  be put down exactly.  Van Helsing and I arrived
at Hiillingham at eight o'clock. It was a lovely morning. The
bright sunshinee and all the fresh feeling  of  early  autumn
seemed  like  the completion  of  nature's  annual work.  The
leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colors,but had
not yet bbegun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
MMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room.  She is always
an early riiser.  She greeted us warmly and said,
     "You  willl  be glad  to know  that Lucy is better.  The
dear chhild is still asleep.  I looked  into her room and saw
her,  but did not  go  in, lest I  should disturb her."  The
Professorr smiled, and looked  quite jubilant.  He rubbed his
hhands  together, and said,  "Aha!  I thought I had diagnosed
the case.   My treatment is working."
     To wwhich she replied, "You must not take all the credit
tto yourself, doctor.  Lucy's  state  this morning is due  in
part to me.."
     "How do yoou mean, ma'am?"  asked the Professor.
     "Well, I wwas anxious about the dear child in the night,
and wennt into her room. She was sleeping soundly, so soundly
that even my coming did not wake her.  But the room  was aw-
fully  sttuffy.  There  were a lot of those horrible, strong-
ssmelling  flowers  about  everywhere, and she had actually a
bunch of thhem round  her neck.  I feared that the heavy odor
wouuld be too  much for  the dear child in her weak state, so
I took them aall  away and  opened a bit of the window to let
in a  little  fresh  air.  You will be pleased with her, I am
sure."
     ShShe moved off into her boudoir,where she usually break-
fasted early.  As she had spoken, I  watched the Professor's
face, andd saw it turn ashen gray. He had been able to retain
hhis self-command  whilst  the  poor lady was present, for he
knew her  sstate and  how mischievous  a  shock would be.  He
acttually smiled on her as he held open the  door  for her to
pass into herr room.  But the instant she  had disappeared he
pulleed me, suddenly and forcibly, into the  dining  room and
closed the doorr.
     Then, for  the  first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing
break   down.  He raised his hands over his head in a sort of
mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless
way.  Finnally he sat  down on a chair, and putting his hands
bbefore his face,began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seem-
ed to come  from the very racking of his heart.
     Then he  raised  his arms again, as though appealing to
the wholee universe.  "God!  God!  God!" he said.  "What have
wwe done, what  has this poor thing done, that we are so sore
beset?  Is   there  fate amongst us still, send down from the
paggan world of  old,  that  such things must be, and in such
way?  This pooor mother, all unknowing, and  all for the best
as shhe think, does such thing as lose her daughter  body and
soul, and we muust not tell her, we must not even  warn  her,
or she  die, then both die.  Oh, how we  are beset!   How are
all the powers of the devils against us!"
     Suddeenly he jumped to his feet.  "Come," he said."come,
wee must see and act.  Devils or no devils, or all the devils
at once, it  matters not. We must fight him all the same." He
wentt to the hall door for his bag,and together we went up to
Lucy's room.

     Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went
towards thhe bed.  This time he did not start as he looked on
thhe poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before.He
wore a look  of stern sadness and infinite pity.
     "As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspir-
ation of  his which meant so much. Without a word he went and
llocked  the  door, and  then began to  set out on the little
table the iinstruments for yet another operation of  transfu-
sioon of blood.  I had long ago recognized the necessity, and
begun to takee off my coat, but he stopped me with  a warning
hand..  "No!" he said.  "Today you must operate. I shall pro-
vide.  You are  weakened already."  As he  spoke he  took off
his coaat and rolled up his shirtsleeve.
      Again the operation.   Again the narcotic.   Again some
return of coolor to the ashy cheeks, and the regular  breath-
ing  of healthy sleep. This time I watched whilst Van Helsing
recruited himsself and rested.
      Presently he  took an opportunity of telling Mrs. West-
enra that   she  must  not remove  anything  from Lucy's room
witthout consulting him.  That the flowers were  of medicinal
value, and thhat the breathing of  their  odor was a  part of
the ssystem of cure.  Then he took over the care of the  case
himself, sayingg that he would watch  this night and the next,
and woould send me word when to come.
      After  another hour  Lucy  waked from  her sleep, fresh
and bright andd  seemingly  not  much the worse  for her ter-
rible  ordeal.
     Whatt  does it all mean?  I am beginning to wonder if my
llong habit of  life  amongst the insane is beginning to tell
upon my ownn brain.

 LUCY W WESTENRA'S DIARY


     17 September.--Four  days  and  nights  of peace.  I am
getting sso strong again that I hardly know myself.  It is as
iif I had passed through some long  nightmare,  and  had just
awakened too see the beautiful  sunshine  and  feel the fresh
airr of the morning  around  me.  I  have  a  dim half remem-
brance of lonng,  anxious times of waiting and fearing, dark-
ness   in which there  was  not even the pain of hope to make
present distresss  more  poignant.  And  then  long spells of
oblivioon, and the rising back to life as  a  diver coming up
through a great  press  of water.  Since,  however,  Dr. Van
Helsing   has been  with me, all  this  bad dreaming seems to
hhave  passed away.  The  noises that used to frighten me out
of  my witss, the  flapping  against the windows, the distant
voiices  which  seemed so  close to me, the harsh sounds that
came from I   know  not  where  and commanded me to do I know
not wwhat, have all ceased.  I go to bed now without any fear
of sleep.  I doo not even try to  keep  awake.  I  have grown
quite ffond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for  me every
day from Haarlem.  Tonight Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as
he has too be for a day  in Amsterdam.  But  I  need  not  be
wwatched.  I am well enough to be left alone.
     Thannk God for Mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for
aall our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel
the change,, for last night Dr.Van Helsing slept in his chair
a llot of the time.  I  found  him asleep twice when I awoke.
But I did nott fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs
or baats  or  something  flapped  almost angrily against  the
window panes.


  THE PALL MALL  GAZETTE 18 September.

 THE ESCAPEPED WOLF
 PERILOUS  ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER
     IINTERVIEW WITH THE KEEPER IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS


     After  many inquiries and  almost as many refusals, and
perpetuallly using the words  `PALL MALL GAZETTE ' as  a sort
off talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section  of
the Zoologiccal Gardens in which the wold department  is  in-
cludded.  Thomas Bilder lives in one of  the  cottages in the
enclosure behiind the  elephant house,  and  was just sitting
down tto his tea when I found him.  Thomas and his  wife  are
hospitable folk,, elderly, and without  children, and  if the
specimenn  I  enjoyed  of their hospitality be of the average

kind, their  lives must  be  pretty comfortable.  The keeper
would not  enter on what he called business until the  supper
waas over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the table was
cleared, andd he had lit his pipe, he said,
      "Now,  Sir,  you  can  go on and arsk me what you want.
You'll excoosee me refoosin' to  talk of perfeshunal subjucts
afore   meals.  I  gives  the  wolves and the jackals and the
hyenas in all ouur section their  tea afore  I begins to arsk
them queestions."
     "Hoow do you mean, ask them questions?" I queried, wish-

ful to get him into a talkative humor.
     " `Ittin'' of them over the `ead with a pole is one way.
Scratcchin' of their ears  in another, when gents as is flush
wants  a  bit off  a show-orf to their gals.  I don't so much
mind thee fust, the `ittin of the pole part afore I chucks in

their dinner, but I waits till  they've `ad their sherry and
kawffee,soo to speak,afore I tries on with the ear scratchin'.
MMind you,"  he added philosophically, "there's a deal of the
same  naturre  in  us as  in them theer animiles.  Here's you
a-ccomin' and arskin' of me questions  about my business, and
I that grump--like that only for your bloomin'  `arf-quid I'd
`a' sseen you blowed fust `fore  I'd  answer.  Not  even when
you  arsked  mee  sarcastic like  if I'd like you to arsk the
Superinntendent if  you  might  arsk  me  questions.  Without
offence did I tell yer to go to `ell?"
     "You didd."
     "An'  wheen  you said  you'd report me for usin' obscene
languaage that was  `ittin' me over  the `ead.  But the `arf-
quid made that aall right.  I weren't  a-goin' to fight, so I
waited ffor the food, and did with my `owl  as the wolves and

lions and tigers does. But, lor' love yer `art, now that the
old  `oomaan  has  stuck  a  chunk of her tea-cake in me, an'
riinsed me out with her bloomin' old teapot,and I've lit hup,
you may scraatch my ears for all you're worth, and won't even
get  a growl out of me.  Drive along with  your questions.  I
know what yer  a-comin' at, that `ere escaped wolf."
     "Exactly.   I want you to give me your view of it.  Just
tell mee how it happened, and when I know  the facts I'll get
you to say what you consider was the cause  of  it, and  how
you thinkk the whole affair will end."
     ""All right, guv'nor. This `ere is about the `ole story.
That`ere wolf whhat we called Bersicker was one of three gray
ones thaat came from Norway to Jamrach's, which we bought off

him four  years ago.  He  was a nice well-behaved wolf, that
never gavee no trouble to talk of.  I'm more surprised at `im
foor wantin' to get out nor  any  other animile in the place.
But, there,  you can't trust wolves no more nor women."
     "Don''t you mind him, Sir!"  broke  in  Mrs. Tom, with a
chheery laugh.  " `E's got mindin' the animiles  so long that
blest if he  ain't like a old wolf `isself!  But there  ain't
no ``arm in `im."
      "Well, Sir,  it  was about two hours after feedin' yes-
terday when I  first hear my  disturbance.  I was makin' up a
litterr in the monkey house for  a  young puma  which is ill.
But when I heardd the yelpin' and `owlin' I kem away straight.
There wwas Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at  the  bars
as if he wanted to get out.  There  wasn't much people about
that day,, and close at hand was  only  one man, a tall, thin
cchap, with a  `ook nose  and  a  pointed  beard,  with a few
white hairss runnin' through it.  He  had  a `ard, cold  look
andd red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike  to  him,  for it
seemed as if  it was `im as they was  hirritated at.  He  `ad
whitee kid gloves on `is `ands, and he  pointed  out the ani-
miles to me andd says, `Keeper,  these wolves  seem  upset at
somethiing.'
     "`Maybee  it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs
as hhe give  `isself.  He  didn't  get  angry, as I  `oped he
would, but he  smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a  mouth
full oof white, sharp teeth. `Oh no, they wouldn't like  me,'
`e says.
     " " `Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin'of him.`They
always like a boone or two to clean their teeth on  about tea
time, whhich you `as a bagful.'
     "Well,  it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us
a-taalkin' they lay down,and when I went over to Bersicker he
let me stroke  his ears same as ever.That there man kem over,
and bllessed but if he didn't put in his hand and  stroke the
old wolf's ears  too!
     " `Tykee care,' says I. `Bersicker is quick.'
     " `Never mmind,' he says.  I'm used to `em!'
      " `Are you in the business yourself?"I says, tyking off
my `at, forr a man what trades in wolves, anceterer,is a good
friiend to keepers.
      " `Nom'  says  he,  `not exactly in the business, but I
`ave made ppets of several.'  and  with that he lifts his `at
as  perlite  as  a lord,  and walks away.  Old Bersicker kep'
a-lookin' artter `im till  `e was out of sight, and then went
and   lay down  in  a  corner and wouldn't come hout the `ole
hevening.  Welll,  larst  night, so soon as the moon was hup,
the  woolves  here all  began a-`owling. There warn't nothing
for them to `owl at.  There  warn't no one near, except some
one that  was evidently a-callin'  a  dog somewheres out back
oof the gardings in the Park road.  Once  or twice I went out
to see thatt all was right, and it was, and  then the `owling
stoopped.  Just  before  twelve  o'clock I just took  a  look
round afore   turnin'  in, an', bust me, but when I kem oppo-
site   to  old  Bersicker's  cage  I see the rails broken and
twisted  about   and  the  cage empty.  And that's all I know
for cerrting."
     "Did  any one else see anything?"
     "OOne of our gard`ners was a-comin' `ome about that time
from a `armony, when he  sees  a  big  gray dog  comin'  out
through tthe garding `edges.At least, so he says, but I don't
ggive much for it myself, for if he did `e never said  a word
about it too his missis when `e got `ome, and it was only af-
terr the escape of the wolf was made known,and we had been up
all night a-hhuntin' of the Park for Bersicker,that he remem-
beredd seein' anything.  My own belief was that  the  `armony
`ad got into hiis `ead."
     "Noow,  Mr. Bilder,  can  you account in any way for the

escape of the wolf?"
     "Well, Siir,"he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty,
"I thiink I  can, but I  don't know as `ow you'd be satisfied
with the theory.."
     "Certainlyy  I  shall.  If a man like you, who knows the
animalss from  experience, can't  hazard  a good guess at any
rate, who is even to try?"
     "wwell then, Sir, I  accounts for it this way.  It seems
to me that  `ere  wolf  escaped--simply because he wanted to
get out.""
     From the heearty way that both Thomas and his wife laugh-
ed at   the joke I could see that it had done service before,
and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell.
I  couldnn't  cope in  badinage with the worthy Thomas, but I
tthought I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said,"Now, Mr.
Bilder, we''ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
andd this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've
told me what  you think will happen."
     "Rightt y`are, Sir," he said briskly. "Ye`ll excoose me,
I kknow, for a-chaffin' of ye, but the  old woman her  winked
at me, which  was as much as telling me to go on."
     "Well, I neever!" said the old lady.
     "My   opinion  is  this.  That  `ere wolf is a`idin' of,
soomewheres.  The  gard`ner  wot  didn't remember said he was
a-gallopin'  northward faster than  a  horse  could go, but I
don''t believe him, for,  yer see,  Sir, wolves don't  gallop
no more nor doogs does, they not bein' built that way. Wolves
is finne things in  a  storybook, and I dessay when they gets
in packs and  dooes be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared
than  thhey  is  they can make a devil of a noise and chop it

up, whatever it is. But, Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf
is only a  low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good
doog, and not half a  quarter so much fight in `im.  This one
ain't been uused to fightin' or even to providin' for hisself,
andd  more  like he's  somewhere  round the Park a'hidin' an'
a'shiverin' oof, and if he thinks at  all, wonderin' where he
is too get his breakfast from.  Or  maybe  he's got down some
area and is in  a coal cellar.  My eye,  won't  some cook get
a rum sstart when she sees his green  eyes a-shinin'  at  her
out of  the dark!  If  he  can't get food he's bound to look
for  it,   and mayhap he  may  chance to light on a butcher's
sshop  in time.  If  he  doesn't, and some nursemaid goes out
walkin' or  orf with a soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the
perrambulator--well,  then  I  shouldn't  be surprised if the
census is onee babby the less.  That's all."
      I  was  handing  him the half-sovereign, when something
came bobbing   up  against the window,  and Mr. Bilder's face
doubleed its natural length with surprise.
     "God bless me!" he said.  "If there ain't old Bersicker
come backk by `isself!"
      He went to the  door  and opened it, a most unnecessary
proceeding  iit  seemed  to me.  I have always thought that a
wild   animal  never  looks  so well as when some obstacle of
pronounced duraability is between us.  A  personal experience
has inttensified rather than diminished that idea.
     Afterr all, however, there is  nothing  like custom, for
neeither  Bilder  nor  his  wife thought any more of the wolf
than I  shouuld  of  a dog.  The animal itself was a peaceful
and  well-behaved as that  father  of all picture-wolves, Red
Riding  Hood'ss  quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence
in massquerade.
     Thee whole scene was a unutterable mixture of comedy and

pathos.  The wicked wolf that for a half a day had paralyzed
London andd set  all  the children in town shivering in their
shhoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood,and was received
and petted llike a sort of vulpine prodigal son.  Old  Bilder
exammined him all over with most tender solicitude, and  when
he had finisheed with his penitent said,
     "Theere,  I  knew  the poor old chap would get into some
kkind of  trouble.  Didn't  I  say  it all along?  Here's his
head all cuut and full of broken glass.  `E's  been a-gettin'
oveer some bloomin' wall or other.  It's  a shyme that people
are allowed tto top their walls  with  broken  bottles.  This
`ere''s what comes of it.  Come along, Bersicker."
     He  took the  wolf  and  locked him up in a cage, with a

piece of meat that satisfied, in  quantity at  any rate, the
elementaryy  conditions  of the fatted calf, and went  off to

     17 September.--I  was engaged after  dinner in my study
posting upp my books, which, through press of  other work and
thhe many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear.  Sud-
denly the dooor was burst open,and in rushed my patient, with
his   face  distorted with passion.  I was thunderstruck, for
such a thing aas a patient getting of his own accord into the
Superiintendent's study is almost unknown.
     Without an instant's notice he made straight at me.  He
had a dinnner knife in his hand,and as I saw he was dangerous,

I  tried to keep the table between us.  He was too quick and
too strongg for me,however, for before I could get my balance
hee had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
     Before hee could strike again, however,I got in my right
hand aand he was sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist
bled freely, andd quite a little pool trickled on to the car-
pet.  I  saw that my friend was not intent on further effort,

and occupied myself binding up my wrist,  keeping a wary eye
on the proostrate figure all the time.  When  the  attendants
ruushed in, and we turned our attention to him,  his  employ-
ment positivvely  sickened me.  He was lying on  his belly on
the  floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen
from  my woundded  wrist.  He  was easily secured, and  to my
surpriise, went with  the attendants  quite placidly,  simply
repeating over aand over again,  "The blood is the life!  The
blood iss the life!"
      I cannot afford  to lose blood just at present.  I have
lost too much oof late for my physical good,and then the pro-
longed  strain of Lucy's  illness and its  horrible phases is
telling on me. I am over excited and weary, and I need rest,
rest,  reest.  Happily  Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I
nneed not forego my sleep.  Tonight I could not well do with-
out it.

 DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

     18 Septetember.--Just off train to London. The arrival of
Van HHelsing's telegram filled me with dismay.  A whole night
lost, and I knoow by bitter  experience what  may happen in a
night.   Of course  it is possible  that all may be well, but
what may have happened?  Surely there  is some horrible doom
hanging   over us  that every possible accident should thwart
uus in all we try to do.  I shall take this cylinder with me,
and then I  can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph.
    MEMORRANDUM LEFT BY LUCY WESTENRA

       17 September, Night.--I  write  this and leave it to be
seen,  so  thatt  no  one  may by any chance get into trouble
throughh me.  This is an  exact record of what took place to-
night.  I  feel  I am  dying  of  weakness,  and have barely
strength  to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing.

     I went to bed as  usual,  taking  care that the flowers
were  placced as  Dr. Van  Helsing  directed,  and  soon fell
assleep.
     I  wass waked  by the  flapping at the window, which had
beggun after  that sleep-walking  on the cliff at Whitby when
Mina  saved mme,  and  which now I  know  so well.  I was not
afraiid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room,
as  Dr. Van Hellsing  said  he would be, so that I might have
called  him.  I tried to  sleep, but I could not.  Then there
came to me  the  old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep
awake.  PPerversely  sleep would  try to come then when I did
nnot want it.  So, as I  feared to be alone, I opened my door
and  calledd out.  "Is there  anybody  there?"   There was no
ansswer.  I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my  door
again.  Then  outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl
like  a dog's, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the win-
dow and looked  out, but could see nothing, except a big bat,
which   had  evidently  been buffeting  its wings against the
window.  So I went back to bed again, but determined  not to
go to sleeep.  Presently the door opened,and mother looked in.

Seeing by my moving that I was not  asleep, she  came in and
sat by me..  She said to me even more sweetly and softly than
heer wont,
     "I   was  uneasy  about you, darling, and came in to see
tthat you were all right."
     I feaared she might  catch cold sitting there, and asked
heer to come in and sleep with  me, so she came into bed, and
lay down besside me.  She did not take off her dressing gown,
for  she said  she would only stay  a  while and then go back
to her own bedd.  As she lay there in my  arms, and I in hers
the  fflapping and  buffeting came to  the window again.  She
was startled andd a little  frightened, and cried out,  "What
is that??"
     I  tried tto pacify  her, and at last succeeded, and she
lay quiiet.  But I could hear her poor dear heart still beat-
ing terribly.  After a while there was the howl again out in
the shrubbbery, and shortly after  there was a crash  at  the
wwindow, and a lot of broken glass was  hurled on  the floor.
The window  blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and
in  the aperture of the broken panes there was the  head of a
great, gaunt  gray wolf.
     MMother  cried  out in a fright, and struggled up into a
sitting posture,, and  clutched wildly at anything that would
help herr.  Amongst  other things, she clutched the wreath of

flowers that Dr. Van Helsing  insisted  on my  wearing round
my neck, aand tore it away from me.  For a second  or two she
saat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was  a  strange  and
horrible gurrgling in her throat.  Then she fell  over, as if
struuck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made
me dizzy for aa moment or two.
      The room and all round seemed to spin round.  I kept my
eyes fixed   on the  window, but the wolf drew his head back,
andd a whole myriad of  little  specks  seems to come blowing
in  through tthe  broken window, and  wheeling  and  circling
roundd  like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when
there is a simooon in the desert.  I tried to stir, but there
was  soome  spell upon me, and dear Mother's poor body, which
seemed  to grow cold  already, for her dear heart had ceased
to  beat,, weighed  me down,  and  I remembered no more for a
wwhile.
     The  ttime did not seem long, but very, very awful, till
I rrecovered  consciousness again.  Somewhere near, a passing
bell was tollling.  The  dogs all round the neighborhood were
howliing, and  in our  shrubbery, seemingly just  outside,  a
nightingale wass singing.  I was dazed  and stupid with  pain
and  teerror and weakness, but  the  sound of the nightingale
seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
me.  The  sounds seemed to have  awakened the maids, too, for
II could hear  their  bare feet pattering outside my door.  I
called to tthem, and they came in, and when they saw what had
happpened, and what it  was that lay over me on the bed, they
screamed out..  The wind rushed in through the broken window,
and   the door slammed  to.  They  lifted off the  body of my
dear mother, annd laid her, covered up  with  a sheet, on the
bed aftter  I had got up.  They  were  all  so frightened and
nervous that I  directed them to  go to  the dining room and
each havee a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant
aand closed again.  The  maids shrieked,  and then went  in a
body to thee dining room, and  I laid  what flowers I  had on
my  dear mother's breast.  When they were  there I remembered
what  Dr. Vann Helsing  had told me, but I didn't like to re-
move  them, and  besides,  I  would have some of the servants
to sit  up withh me now.  I was  surprised that the maids did
not comme back.  I called them, but  got no answer, so I went
to the dining room to look for them.
     My heart ssank when  I saw what  had happened.  They all
four laay helpless on the floor,  breathing heavily.  The de-
canter  of  sherry was on the table half full, but there was
a queer,  acrid  smell about.  I was suspicious, and examined
tthe  decanter.  It  smelt  of laudanum,  and  looking on the
sideboard,II found that the bottle which Mother's doctor uses
forr her--oh! did use--was empty.  What am I to do? What am I
to do? I am bback in the room with Mother.I cannot leave her,
and II am alone, save for the sleeping  servants,  whom  some
one has druggedd. Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for
I  can   hear  the  low  howl  of the wolf through the broken
window.
     Thee  air seems full of specks, floating and circling in

the draught  from  the  window, and the lights burn blue and
dim.  Whatt am I to do?  God  shield me from harm this night!
I  shall hide this paper in my breast,  where they shall find
it  when  thhey come to lay me out.  My dear mother gone!  It
is ttime that  I  go too.  Goodbye, dear  Arthur, if I should
not survive thhis night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!

                      DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


     18 September.--I drove  at once  to  Hillingham and ar-
rived earlly.  Keeping  my  cab at the gate, I  went  up  the
avvenue alone.  I knocked  gently and rang as quietly as pos-
sible, for II feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped
to oonly bring a servant to the door.  After a while, finding
no response, II  knocked and rang again, still no  answer.  I
cursedd  the  laziness  of  the servants that they should lie
abed at such an  hour,for it was now ten o'clock, and so rang
and knoccked again, but more impatiently,  but  still without

response.  Hitherto I had blamed  only the servants, but now
a terriblee fear began to assail me.  Was this desolation but
annother link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight
round us? Waas it indeed a house of death to which I had come,
tooo late?  I know that minutes, even seconds of delay, might
mean hours  oof  danger to  Lucy, if she had had again one of
thosee frightful relapses, and  I went round the house to try
if I could findd by chance an entry anywhere.
    II could find no means of ingress.  Every window and door
was fastened annd locked, and I returned baffled to the porch.
As I ddid so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a  swiftly  driven
horse's feet.  TThey stopped at the gate, and a  few  seconds
later I  met Van Helsing running up the avenue.  When he  saw

me, he gasped out, "Then it was you, and  just arrived.  How
is she? Arre we too late?  Did you not get my telegram?"
     I  answered as quickly  and coherently as I could that I
had only got his telegram early in the  morning, and had not
a minute  in coming here, and that I could  not  make any one
iin the house hear me.  He paused and  raised his hat  as  he
said solemnnly, "Then I fear we are too  late.  God's will be
donne!"
     With  hiis usual recuperative energy, he went on, "Come.
If thhere be no way open  to get  in, we must make one.  Time
is all in all tto us now."
     WWe went round to the back of the house, where there was
a kitchen windoww.  The Professor took a small  surgical  saw
from hiss case, and handing it to me,pointed to the iron bars

which guarded the window.  I attacked them  at once  and had
very soon  cut through three of them.  Then with a long, thin
knnife we pushed back the fastening of the  sashes and opened
the window.   I helped the Professor  in, and  followed  him.
Therre was no one in the kitchen or in  the  servants' rooms,
which were cloose at hand. We tried  all the rooms as we went
along,, and in the dining room,  dimly  lit  by rays of light
through the shuttters, found four  servant women lying on the
floor. TThere was no need to think them dead, for their ster-

torous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room
left no dooubt as to their condition.
     Vann Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved

away he said, "We can attend to them later."Then we ascended
to Lucy's  room.  For an instant or two we paused at the door
too listen, but there was no sound that we could  hear.  With
white faces  and trembling hands, we  opened the door gently,
and  entered the room.
     How  shall I  describe what we saw?  On the bed lay two
women, Luucy and her mother.  The latter lay farthest in, and
sshe was covered with a white sheet, the edge  of  which  had
been blown  back by the drought through  the  broken  window,
shoowing the drawn, white, face, with a look of  terror fixed
upon it.  By  her side  lay Lucy, with face  white and  still
more  drawn.  The flowers which had been  round  her  neck we
found upon her  mother's bosom, and her throat was bare,show-
ing thee two little wounds which we had noticed  before,  but
looking horribly white and mangled.  Without a word the Pro-
fessor beent  over the  bed,  his  head  almost touching poor
LLucy's breast.  Then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of
one who lisstens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me,
"IIt is not yet too late!  Quick!  Quick! Bring the brandy!"
     I flew ddownstairs and returned with  it, taking care to
smelll and taste it, lest it, too, were  drugged like the de-
canter of sherrry which I found on the table.  The maids were
still bbreathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the
narcotic was wearing off.  I did not stay to  make sure, but
returned  to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another
ooccasion,  on  her lips and  gums  and on her wrists and the
palms of heer hands.  He said to me, "I can do this, all that
cann be at the present.  You go wake those maids.  Flick them
in the face wwith a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them
get hheat and fire and a warm bath.  This poor soul is nearly
as cold as thatt beside her.  She will need be heated  before
we can  do anything more."
     I went at   once, and  found little difficulty in waking
three off  the  women.  The fourth was only a young girl, and

the drug had evidently affected her more strongly so I lift-
ed her on  the sofa and let her sleep.
     Thhe others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came
back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I
was sternn with them, however, and would not let them talk. I
ttold  them that one life was bad enough to lose, and if they
delayed theey would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and cry-
ingg they went about their way,  half clad  as they were, and
prepared firee and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler
firess were  still alive, and there was no lack of hot water.
We  got  a bathh  and  carried Lucy out as she was and placed
her in  it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a
knock at the  hall  door.  One of the maids ran off, hurried
on some   more clothes, and opened it.  Then she returned and
wwhispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with
a  message   from Mr. Holmwood.  I  bade her  simply tell him
thaat  he  must wait, for  we could see no one now.  She went
away with thee message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean
forgoot all about him.

     I never saw in  all my experience the Professor work in
such  deaddly  earnest.  I knew,  as  he  knew, that it was a
sttand-up fight with death, and in a pause  told  him so.  He
answered me  in a way that I did not understand, but with the
sterrnest look that his face could wear.
     "If that  were all, I would stop here where we are now,
and let hher fade away into peace, for I see no light in life
oover her horizon."  He went on  with his work with, if poss-
ible, renewwed and more frenzied vigour.
     PPresently we  both began  to be conscious that the heat
was beginning  tto be  of  some effect.  Lucy's  heart beat a
trifle mmore audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had  a

perceptible movement.  Van Helsing's face almost beamed, and
as we liftted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet
too dry her he said to me, "The first gain is ours!  Check to
the King!"

     We  took  Lucy into another room, which had by now been
prepared,   and laid her in  bed  and  forced a  few drops of
brrandy down her throat.  I noticed that  Van Helsing  tied a
soft silk  hhandkerchief round  her  throat.  She  was  still
uncoonscious,  and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we
had ever seen  her.
     Van Hellsing called in one of the women, and told her to
stayy  with her and not to take her eyes off her till we  re-
turned, and thhen beckoned me out of the room.
      "We must  consult as to what is to be done," he said as
we  descendedd  the stairs.  In the hall he opened the dining
room  door,  and we passed in,  he closing the door carefully
behind  him.  TThe  shutters had  been opened, but the blinds
were allready down, with  that  obedience to the etiquette of
death which the British woman of  the  lower  classes always
rigidly oobserves.  The room was, therefore, dimly  dark.  It
wwas, however, light enough for our purposes.   Van Helsing's
sternness wwas somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity.  He
wass evidently torturing his mind about something,so I waited
for an instannt, and he spoke.

     "What are we to do now?  Where are we to turn for help?
We must haave another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or
thhat poor girl's life won't be worth an hour's purchase. You
are exhausteed already.  I am exhausted too.  I fear to trust
thosse women, even if they would have courage to submit. What
are we to do ffor some one who will open his veins for her?"
     "WWhat's the matter with me, anyhow?"

     The  voice came from the  sofa across the room, and its
tones brouught relief and joy to my heart,for they were those
off Quincey Morris.

     Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his
face softeened and a  glad look came into his eyes as I cried
ouut,  "Quincey  Morris!"  and  rushed  towards him with out-
stretched haands.
     "What bbrought you her?" I cried as our hands met.
     "I guuess Art is the cause."
     He  hannded me a telegram.-- `Have not heard from Seward
for  three days, and am terribly anxious.Cannot leave. Father
still in same  condition.  Send me  word how  Lucy is. Do not
delay..--Holmwood.'
      "I think I came just in the nick of time.  You know you
have only to ttell me what to do."
     Van Helsinng  strode forward, and took his hand, looking
him strraight in the eyes as he said, "A brave man's blood is
the  best  thing  on  this earth when a woman is in trouble.
You're  aa  man  and  no  mistake.  Well,  the devil may work
aagainst us for all he's worth,  but God sends us men when we
want them.""
     Once  againn  we went through that ghastly operation.  I
have nott the heart to go through with the details.  Lucy had

got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before,for
though pleenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not
reespond to the treatment as well as on the other  occasions.
Her strugglee back into life was something frightful  to  see
and  hear.  However, the action of both heart  and lungs  im-
proved, and  VVan Helsing made  a sub-cutaneous  injection of
morphiia, as before,  and with good effect.  Her faint became
a  profound  sluumber.  The  Professor  watched whilst I went
downstaiirs with Quincey Morris, and  sent  one of  the maids

to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting.
     II left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine,
and told  the  ccook to  get  ready a good breakfast.  Then a
thought  struck me, and I  went  back  to the room where Lucy

now was.  When I came softly in, I  found Van Helsing with a
sheet or ttwo of note paper  in his hand.  He  had  evidently
reead it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to
his brow.  TThere was a look of grim satisfaction in his face,
as  of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper
saying only,  "It dropped from Lucy's breast when we  carried
her tto the bath."
      When I had  read  it, I stook looking at the Professor,
and after a  ppause  asked him, "In God's  name, what does it
all meean?  Was she, or is she, mad, or  what  sort of horri-
ble danger is itt?"  I was so bewildered that I  did not know
what to  say  more.  Van Helsing put  out  his  hand and took

the paper, saying,
     "Do  not  ttrouble about it now.  Forget if for the pre-
sent. Yoou shall know and understand it all in good time, but

it will be later.  And now what is it that you came to me to
say?"   Thhis  brought  me back to fact, and I was all myself
aggain.
     "I camee to speak about the certificate of death.If we do
nott act properly and wisely, there  may be  an  inquest,  and
that paper wwould have to be produced.  I am in hopes  that we
neeed have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor
Lucy, if notthing else did.  I know, and  you  know,  and  the
othher doctor who attended her knows, that  Mrs. Westenra  had
disease of tthe heart, and we can certify that she died of it.
Lett us fill up the certificate at once, and  I shall  take it
myself to thhe registrar and go on to the undertaker."
     "Good,, oh my friend John!  Well thought  of!  Truly Miss
Luucy, if she be sad in the  foes that beset  her, is at least
happy in thhe friends thatlove her.  One, two, three, all open
thheir veins for her, besides one old man.  Ah, yes,  I  know,
friend Johnn.  I am not blind! I love you all the more for it!
Noow go."
     In  tthe  hall I  met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for
AArthur  telling  him that  Mrs. Westenra was  dead, that Lucy
also had bbeen ill, but was now going on better, and that  Van
HHelsing and I were with her.  I told him where I  was  going,
and he hurrried me out, but as I was going  said,
    "When you  come back, Jack, may I have two words with  you
all tto ourselves?"  I nodded in reply and went out.I found no
difficulty aboout the registration,and arranged with the local
underrtaker to come up  in  the  evening  to  measure  for the
coffin and to  make arrangements.
     When I got  back Quincey was waiting for me.  I told  him
I wouldd see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and  went up to
her room. She waas still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly
had nott moved from his seat at her side. From his putting his
finger to his liips, I gathered that he  expected  her to wake
before  long and was afraid of fore-stalling nature. So I went
down to Quincey  and took him  into  the breakfast room, where
the bliinds were not drawn  down,  and which was a little more
cheerful, or ratther less cheerless, than the other rooms.
     When wwe were alone, he said to me, "Jack Seward, I don't
waant to shove myself  in anywhere where  I've no right to be,
but this iss no ordinary case.  You know I loved that girl and
waanted to marry her, but although that's all past and gone, I
can't help   feeling  anxious about her all the same.  What is
itt that's wrong with her? The Dutchman, and a fine old fellow
is is, I caan  see  that, said that time you two came into the
rooom, that  you must  have  another transfusion of blood, and
that both yyou and he were exhausted. Now I know well that you
meedical men speak in camera, and that  a  man must not expect
to know whaat they consult about in private.  But  this is  no
coommon matter, and whatever it is, I have done my part.Is not
that so?"

     "That's so," I said, and he went on.
     "I  taake  it that both you and Van Helsing had done al-
reaady what I did today.  Is not that so?"
     "That's sso."
     "And  I   guess Art  was in it too.  When I saw him four
days  ago down at his own place  he looked queer.  I have not
seen anything ppulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas
and hadd a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night.
One of those bigg bats that they call vampires had got at her
in the nnight,and what with his gorge and the vein left open,

there wasn't  enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I
had to  puut  a  bullet through her as she lay.  Jack, if you
maay  tell  me without  betraying  confidence, Arthur was the
first, is noot that so?"
      As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He
was in a  tortuure  of suspense regarding the woman he loved,
and hiss utter  ignorance of the terrible mystery which seem-
ed to  surround her  intensified his  pain.  His  very heart
was bleedding, and  it took all the manhood of him, and there
wwas a royal lot  of it, too, to keep him from breaking down.
I paused beefore answering, for I felt that I must not betray
anyything which the Professor wished kept secret, but already
he knew so muuch, and guessed so much, that there could be no
reasoon for not answering, so I answered in the same  phrase.
     "That's soo."
     "And how  long has this been going on?"
      "About ten days."
     "Ten days!  Then  I  guess, Jack Seward, that that poor
pretty crreature that we all  love has had put into her veins
wwithin that  time  the blood of four strong men.  Man alive,
her whole bbody wouldn't  hold it."  Then coming close to me,
he  spoke in a fierce half-whisper.  "What took it out?"

     I  shook my  head.  "That,"  I said, "is the crux.  Van
Helsing iss simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end.
II can't even hazard a  guess.  There has been  a  series  of
little  cirrcumstances which have thrown out all our calcula-
tioons as  to  Lucy  being properly watched.  But these shall
not occur agaain.  Here we stay until all be well, or ill."
     Quuincey held out his hand. "Count me in," he said. "You
and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I'll do it."
     When sshe woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first move-
mennt was to feel in her breast, and to my surprise, produced
the paper whiich Van Helsing had given me to read.  The care-
ful PProfessor had replaced it where it  had come from,  lest
on waking she sshould be alarmed.  Her eyes  then lit  on Van
Helsingg and on me too, and gladdened.  Then she looked round
the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered.  She  gave  a
loud cry,, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face.
      We both understood what was meant,  that she had  real-
ized  to thee  full her mother's  death.  So we tried what we
coulld to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat,
but she was veery low in thought and spirit,and wept silently
and weeakly for a long time.  We told her that either or both
of us would now  remain with her all the time,and that seemed
to comfoort her.  Towards dusk she  fell into a doze.  Here a

very odd thing occurred.  Whilst still asleep  she  took the
paper fromm her breast and tore it in two.Van Helsing stepped
ovver  and took the  pieces from her.  All the same, however,
she went on  with the action of tearing, as though the mater-
ial  were still in  her  hands.  Finally she lifted her hands
and opened theem  as  though  scattering  the fragments.  Van
Helsinng seemed  surprised, and  his  brows gathered as if in
thought, but he  said nothing.

 
     19 September.--All last night she slept fitfully, being
always  afrraid  to sleep, and something weaker when she woke
froom it.  The Professor and I took in turns to watch, and we
never left heer for a moment unattended.  Quincey Morris said
nothiing about his intention, but I knew that all night  long
he patrolled roound and round the house.
     When   the day came, its searching light showed the rav-
agges in poor  Lucy's  strength.  She was hardly able to turn
her head,  aand  the  little nourishment which she could take
seemmed to do her no good.  At times she slept, and both  Van
Helsing and I  noticed the difference in her, between  sleep-
ing annd waking.  Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although
more haggard, annd her breathing was softer.  Her  open mouth
showed tthe pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which looked

positively longer and sharper than usual.  When she woke the
softness oof her eyes evidently changed  the  expression, for
shhe looked her own self, although a dying one. In the after-
noon she askked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.Quinc-
ey wwent off to meet him at the station.
     When he arrived it  was nearly six o'clock, and the sun
was settiing  full  and  warm,  and the red light streamed in
tthrough  the window  and gave more color to the pale cheeks.
When he saww her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and
nonne of us could speak.In the hours that had passed,the fits
of sleep, or  the comatose condition that passed  for it, had
grownn more frequent,so that the pauses when conversation was
possible were sshortened.  Arthur's presence, however, seemed
to act  as a stimulant.She rallied a little, and spoke to him
more brightly than she  had  done  since we arrived.  He too
pulled hiimself together,  and spoke as cheerily as he could,
sso that the best was made of everything.
     It is  nnow  nearly  one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing
are ssitting with her.  I  am  to  relieve  them in a quarter
of an hour,and  I am entering this on Lucy's phonograph.Until
six o'cclock they are to try to rest.  I  fear that  tomorrow
will end our watching, for the shock has been too great. The
poor chilld cannot rally.  God help us all.


 LETTER MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA
         (Unopeened by her)

          17 September

My dearest Lucyy,
     "It seems  an age since I heard from you,or indeed since
I wrotee.  You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when
you have read all my budget of  news.  Well,  I got  my hus-
band backk all right.  When  we arrived at Exeter there was a
ccarriage waiting for us, and  in it, though he had an attack
of gout, Mrr. Hawkins.  He  took us to his house, where there
werre  rooms for  us  all nice  and comfortable, and we dined
together.  Affter dinner Mr. Hawkins said,
     "" `My  dears, I  want to drink your health and prosper-
ity, and  may  eevery  blessing  attend you both.  I know you
both froom children, and have, with  love and pride, seen you

grow up.  Now I want you to make  your  home here with me. I
have left  to me neither chick nor child.All are gone, and in
myy will I have left you everything.'  I cried, Lucy dear, as
Jonathan andd the old man clasped hands.   Our  evening was a
veryy, very happy one.
     "So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house,
and from  both my bedroom  and the drawing room I can see the
ggreat elms of the  cathedral  close,  with their great black
stems standding out against the old yellow stone of the cath-
edrral, and I can  hear  the rooks overhead cawing and cawing
and  chatteriing and  chattering and gossiping all day, after
the mmanner of rooks--and humans.  I am busy, I need not tell
you,  arrangingg  things  and housekeeping.  Jonathan and Mr.
Hawkinss are busy all day,for now that Jonathan is a partner,
Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients.
     "How  is  your  dear mother getting on?  I wish I could
run up too town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I,dare
nnot go yet, with so much on my shoulders, and Jonathan wants
looking aftter still.He is beginning to put some flesh on his
bonnes again,but he was terribly weakened by the long illness.
Even now he   sometimes starts  out  of his sleep in a sudden
way   and  awakes  all trembling until I can coax him back to
his usual placcidity.However, thank God, these occasions grow
less ffrequent as the days go on, and  they will in time pass
away altogether,, I  trust.  And now I have told you my news,
let me aask yours. When are you to be married, and where, and

who is to perform the ceremony,and what are you to wear, and
is it to bbe a public or private wedding?  Tell  me all about
itt, dear, tell me all about everything, for there is nothing
which intereests  you which will not be dear to me.  Jonathan
askss me to send his  `respectful duty',  but I do not  think
that is good eenough from the junior partner of the important
firm HHawkins & Harker.  And so, as you love me, and he loves
me,and I love yoou with all the moods and tenses of the verb,
I send yyou  simply  his `love' instead.  Goodbye, my dearest

Lucy, and blessings on you."
Yours,,
Mina Harker

 
 REPORT FROM PATRICK HENNESSEY, MD, MRCSLK, QCPI, ETC, ETC,
TO JOHN SEWAARD, MD
        200 September

My d dear Sir:
     "Inn  accordance  with  your wishes, I enclose report of

the conditions of everything left in my charge.  With regard
to  patiennt, Renfield, there is more to say.  He has had an-
otther outbreak, which might have had a dreadful  ending, but
which, as itt fortunately  happened,  was unattended with any
unhaappy results.This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men
made a call att the empty house whose  grounds  abut on ours,
the hoouse to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran
away.  The men sstopped at our gate  to ask the  porter their
way, as  they were strangers.
     "I was myyself looking out of the study window, having a
smoke  after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house.
As  he passed tthe window of Renfield's room, the patient be-
gan to  rate him from  within,  and  called  him all the foul
names he could lay his tongue to.  The man, who seemed a de-
cent felllow enough,contented himself by telling him to `shut
uup for a foul-mouthed beggar',whereon our man accused him of
robbing himm and wanting to murder him and said that he would
hinnder him if he were to swing for it.  I opened the  window
and signed too the man not to notice, so he contented himself
afterr looking the place over and making up his  mind  as  to
what kind of pllace he had got to by saying, `Lor' bless yer,
sir, I  wouldn't  mind what was said to me in a bloomin' mad-
house.  I pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to  live in the
house witth a wild beast like that.'
     "Thhen  he asked his  way civilly enough, and I told him

where the gate of the empty house was.  He went away follow-
ed by threeats and curses and revilings from our man.  I went
doown  to see  if  I could  make out any cause for his anger,
since he is  usually  such a well-behaved man, and except his
viollent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred.  I found
him, to my asttonishment, quite  composed and  most genial in
his maanner.  I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but
he blandly askedd me questions as to what I meant, and led me
to belieeve that he was completely oblivious of  the  affair.

It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of
his cunninng, for within half an hour I heard  of him  again.
Thhis time he had broken out through the  window of his room,
and was runnning down the avenue. I called to the attendants
to foollow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
on some mischieff. My fear was justified when I saw the same
cart whicch had passed before coming down the road,having on
itt some great wooden boxes. The men were wiping their fore-
heads, and weere flushed in the face, as if with violent ex-
ercisee. Before I could get up to him, the patient rushed at
them, and  pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock
his head aagainst  the ground.  If I had not seized him just
at  the moment, I believe he would have killed the man there
and then.  Thee other fellow jumped down and struck him over
the  heead with the butt  end  of  his heavy whip.  It was a

horrible blow, but he did not seem  to  mind it, but seized
him also, aand struggled with the three of us, pulling us to
and  fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no lightweight,
and the otherss were both burly men.  At first he was silent
in his  fighting, but as we began to master him, and the at-

tendants were putting a strait waistcoat on him,he began to
shout, `I'lll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!They shan't
murdder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!'and
all sorts of siimilar incoherent  ravings.  It was with very
considerrable difficulty that they got him back to the house
aand  put  him  in the  padded room.  One of the attendants,
Hardy, had aa finger broken.However, I set it all right, and
he iss going on well.
      "The  two carriers were at first loud in their threats
of actions ffor  damages, and  promised to rain all the pen-
altiees  of  the law  on  us.   Their threats were, however,
mingled with somme sort of indirect  apology  for the defeat
of the twwo of them by a feeble madman.  They  said  that if
itt had not been for the way  their strength  had been spent
in carrying   and raising  the heavy boxes  to the cart they
would  have made  short  work of him.  They gave  as another
reason  for their defeat the  extraordinary state of drouth
to  which   they  had  been  reduced  by the dusty nature of
theeir occupation and the reprehensible  distance  from  the
scene of theirr labors of any place of public entertainment.
I quitee understood their drift, and after a stiff glass  of

strong grog, or rather more of the  same, and  with each  a
sovereign iin hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
thatt  they  would  encounter a worse madman any day for the
pleasure  of  mmeeting  so  `bloomin' good a bloke'  as your
correspoondent.  I took their names and  addresses, in  case
tthey  might be needed.  They are as follows:  Jack Smollet,
of Dudding'ss Rents, King George's Road, Great Walworth, and
Thomaas  Snelling,  Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal
Green.  They  arre both  in the employment of Harris & Sons,
Moving annd  Shipment  Company, Orange  Master's Yard, Soho.
      "I shall report to you any matter of  interest occurr-
ing here, andd shall wire you at once if there is anything of
imporrtance.
        "BBelieve me, dear Sir,
        "Yourss faithfully,
         "Patrick Hennessey."

"My y dearest Lucy,
      "Such a sad blow has befallen us.  Mr. Hawkins has died
very suddenlyy.  Some may not  think it so sad for us, but we
had bboth come to so love him that  it really seems as though
we had lost a ffather.  I never knew either father or mother,
so thatt the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.  Jon-
athan is greatly distressed.  It is  not  only that he feels
sorrow, ddeep sorrow,for the dear,good man who has befriended
hhim all his life,and now at the end has treated him like his
own son andd left him a fortune which to people of our modest
briinging up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jona-
than feels itt on another account.  He says the amount of re-
sponssibility  which  it puts upon him makes him nervous.  He
begins to doubtt himself.I try to cheer him up, and my belief
in him  helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here
that the grave shock that he experienced tells  upon him the
most. Oh,, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong
nnature  such as his, a nature which enabled him by our dear,
good  friennd's  aid to  rise  from  clerk to master in a few
yeaars,  should be  so  injured  that the very essence of its
strength is   gone.  Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my
troubbles in the  midst of your own happiness, but Lucy dear,
I must tell sommeone,for the strain of keeping up a brave and
cheerfuul  appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one
here that I can confide in.  I dread coming up to London, as
we must ddo that day after tomorrow, for poor Mr.Hawkins left
iin his will  that he was to  be buried in the grave with his
father. As  there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have
to  be chief  mourner.  I  shall  try to run over to see you,
dearest,if onnly for a few minutes.  Forgive me for troubling
you.   With all blessings,

 DR. SSEWARD' DIARY

       20 September.--Only  resolution  and  habit  can let me
make an entrry tonight. I am too miserable, too low spirited,
too  sick of the world and all in it, including life  itself,
that I would nnot care if I heard this moment the flapping of
the wiings of the angel of  death.  And he  has been flapping
those grim wingss to some purpose of late, Lucy's  mother and
Arthur'ss father, and now . . .Let me get on with my work.
      I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.  We
wanted Arthurr to go to rest also, but he refused  at  first.
It waas only when I told him that we should  want him to help
us during the   day, and that we must not  all break down for
want off rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.
     Van Helsing was very kind to him.  "Come, my child," he
said.  "CCome with me.  You  are  sick and weak, and have had
mmuch sorrow and much mental pain,as well as that tax on your
strength thhat we know of.  You  must not be alone, for to be
aloone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing
room, where tthere is a big fire, and there are two sofas.You
shalll lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy  will
be comfort to   each other, even though we do not  speak, and
even iff we sleep."
      Arthur  went  off with him, casting back a longing look
on Lucy's face,, which lay in  her pillow, almost whiter than
the lawwn.  She lay quite still, and I looked around the room
to see that all  was  as it should be.  I could see that the
Professorr had carried out in this room, as in the other, his
ppurpose of using the garlic.  The whole of the window sashes
reeked withh  it,  and round Lucy's neck, over the silk hand-
kerrchief  which  Van  Helsing  made her keep on, was a rough
chaplet of thhe same odorous flowers.
     Lucy wwas breathing somewhat  stertorously, and her face
wass at  its  worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums.
Her teeth, inn  the  dim, uncertain  light, seemed longer and
sharpper than they had been  in  the morning.  In particular,
by some trick   of  the light, the canine teeth looked longer
and shaarper than the rest.
     I sat downn  beside  her, and presently she moved uneas-
ily.  AAt the same moment there  came a sort of dull flapping
or buffeting at  the  window.  I went over to it softly, and
peeped  oout  by the  corner of the  blind.  There was a full
mmoonlight,and I could see that the noise was made by a great
bat, which  wheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light,
altthough so  dim,  and every now and again struck the window
with its winggs.  When  I  came back to my seat, I found that
Lucy  had moved slightly,and had torn away the garlic flowers
from her throatt. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat
watchinng her.
     Preseently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing
haad prescribed.  She took but a little, and  that languidly.
There did noot seem to be with her now the unconscious strug-
gle   for  life  and strength that had hitherto so marked her
illness.  It sstruck me as curious that the moment she became
consciious she  pressed the  garlic flowers close to her.  It
was certainly oddd that whenever  she got into that lethargic
state,   with  the  stertorous breathing, she put the flowers

from  her,  but that when she waked she clutched them close,
There was  no  possibility  of making amy mistake about this,
foor in the long  hours  that  followed, she  had many spells
of sleeping  and waking and repeated both actions many times.
      At six o'clock Van Helsing came  to relieve me.  Arthur
had then falleen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep
on.  WWhen he saw Lucy's face I could hear the sissing indraw
of breath, and hhe said to me in a sharp whisper."Draw up the
blind. II want light!"  Then he bent down, and, with his face

almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully.   He removed
the flowerrs and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat.
AAs  he  did so he started back and I could hear his ejacula-
tion, "Meinn Gott!"  as it was smothered  in  his  throat.  I
bennt over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill
came over me.. The  wounds on  the throat had absolutely dis-
appeaared.
     For fullly five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her,
witth his face at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said
calmly, "She  is dying.  It will not be long now.  It will be
much  difference, mark me, whether  she dies conscious  or in
her sleep.  Wakke that poor boy, and let him come and see the
last.   He trusts us, and we have promised him."
     I went  to the dining room and waked him.  He  was dazed
for  a moment,  but when  he saw  the sunlight  streaming  in
through the eddges of the shutters he thought he was late,and
expresssed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still asleep,
but told him ass gently as i could that both Van Helsing  and
I feareed that the end was near. He covered his face with his
hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa,  where he re-
mained, pperhaps a minute, with  his  head  buried,  praying,
wwhilst his shoulders shook  with grief.  I took  him by  the
hand and raaised him up. "Come," I said, "my dear old fellow,
summmon all your fortitude.  It will be best and easiest  for
her."
     W When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Hel-
sing had,  with   his usual forethought, been putting matters
straightt and making everything look as pleasing as possible.

He  had  even  brushed  Lucy's hair,  so that  it lay on the
pillow in   its usual  sunny  ripples.  When we came into the
rooom she opened  her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly,
"Arthur!  Ohh, my love, I am so glad you have come!"
     He was sstooping to kiss her,  when Van Helsing motioned
him bback.  "No,"  he whispered, "not yet!  Hold her hand, it
will comfort heer more."
     So   Arthur took  her hand and knelt beside her, and she

looked her best,with all the soft lines matching the angelic
beauty of  her eyes.  Then gradually her eyes closed, and she
saank to sleep.  For a  little  bit her breast heaved softly,
and her breaath came and went like a tired child's.
     And then  insensibly there came the strange change which
I had  noticed in the night.  Her  breathing grew stertorous,
the  mouth  openned,  and the pale gums, drawn back, made the
teeth loook longer and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-

waking, vague, unconscious  way she  opened her eyes,  which
were now ddull and hard at once,and said in a soft,voluptuous
vooice, such as I had never heard from her lips, "Arthur! Oh,
my love, I aam so glad you have come!  Kiss me!"
     Arthur  bent  eagerly over to kiss her, but at that in-
stant Vann Helsing, who,  like me,  had  been startled by her
vvoice, swooped upon him, and  catching him  by the neck with
both hands,,  dragged  him back with a fury of strength which
I nnever thought he could  have possessed, and actually hurl-
ed him almostt across the room.
    "Not on your life!"  he said,  "not for your living soul
and hers!!"  And he stood between them like a lion at bay.
      Arthur was so taken aback that  he did not for a moment
know what to ddo or say,  and  before any impulse of violence
could  seize him he realized the  place and the occasion, and
stood silent, waaiting.
     I  keept my  eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and
wee saw a spasm as  of rage flit like a shadow over her face.
The sharp teeeth clamped together.  Then her eyes closed, and
she  breathed heavily.
     Very  shortly  after  she opened  her eyes in all their
softness,, and  putting  out her  poor, pale, thin hand, took
VVan Helsing's great brown  one, drawing it close to her, she
kissed it.   "My true friend," she said, in a faint voice,but
witth untellable pathos, "My true friend, and his!  Oh, guard
him, and givee me peace!"
      "I  swear  it!"   he said solemnly, kneeling beside her
and holding up  his hand, as  one who registers an oath. Then
he turnned to Arthur, and said to him,  "Come, my child, take
her hand  in  yours, and kiss her  on the forehead, and only
once."
 
     Their eyes met instead of their lips, and so they part-
ed. Lucy's  eyes closed, and Van Helsing, who had been watch-
ingg closely, took Arthur's arm, and drew him away.
      And  then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and
all at once it  ceased.
     "It  is all over," said Van Helsing.  "She is dead!"
      I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the draw-
ing room,  wherre  he sat down, and covered his face with his
hands,  sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.
      I went back to the room,  and found Van Helsing looking
at poor Lucyy, and his face was sterner than eve. Some change
had  come over her body.  Death had given  back part  of  her
beauty, for heer brow and cheeks had recovered some of  their
flowinng lines.  Even the lips had lost their deadly  pallor.
It was as if thee blood, no longer needed for the  working of
the hearrt, had gone to make the harshness of death as little

rude as might be.

"We thought herr dying whilst she slept,
 And sleepping when she died."

     I stood d  beside  Van Helsing,  and said, "Ah well, poor
girl,, there is peace for her at last.  It is the end!"
      He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity,"Not so,
alas!  Not soo.  It is only the beginning!"
      When I asked him what he meant,  he only shook his head
and answered,   "We can do nothing as yet.  Wait and see."


CHAPTEPTER 13

                 DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--cont.

       The  funeral  was arranged for the next succeeding day,
so  that Luccy  and her  mother might  be buried together.  I
atteended  to  all the  ghastly  formalities,  and the urbane
undertaker prooved that his staff was afflicted,  or blessed,
with   something  of  his own obsequious  suavity.  Even  the
woman who perforrmed the last offices for the  dead  remarked
to me, iin  a   confidential, brother-professional  way, when

she had come out from the death chamber,
     "She  mmakes  a very beautiful corpse,  sir.  It's quite
a prrivilege to attend on her. It's not  too much to say that
she will do crredit to our establishment!"
     I  noticed that Van Helsing  never  kept far away.  This
was  possible  from  the  disordered state  of things in the
householdd.  There were no relatives  at hand, and  as Arthur
hhad to be back the  next day to attend at his father's  fun-
eral, we weere unable to notify any one who should have  been
biddden.  Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I  took it
upon  ourselvves  to  examine papers, etc.  He  insisted upon
lookiing over Lucy's papers himself.  I asked him  why, for I
feared that he,, being a foreigner, might  not be quite aware
of Engllish legal requirements,and so might in ignorance make
some unnecessary trouble.
     He  answered me, "I know, I know. You forget that I am a

lawyer as well as a doctor.  But this is not  altogether for
the law.   You knew that, when you  avoided the   coroner.  I
haave more than him to avoid.  There may be papers more, such
as this."
 
     As he spoke he took from his pocket book the memorandum
which had bbeen in Lucy's breast, and which she  had  torn in
herr sleep.
     "Wheen you find anything of the solicitor who is for the
llate Mrs.Westenra, seal all her papers,and write him tonight.
For me, I  watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room
alll night, and I myself search for what  may be.  It  is not
well that heer very thoughts go into the hands of strangers."
      I went on with my part of the work, and in another half
hour had foundd the name and address of  Mrs. Westenra's sol-
icitorr and  had  written to him.  All the poor lady's papers
were  in  order..  Explicit directions regarding the place of
burial wwere given.  I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to

my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying,
     "Can I helpp you friend John?   I am free, and if I may,
my serviice is to you."
      "Have you got what you looked for?" I asked.
      To which  he  replied, "I did not look for any specific
thing. I only hhoped to find, and find I have, all that there
was, onnly  some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new
begun.  But I  have them  here, and we shall for the present
say  nothhing of  them.  I  shall see  that poor lad tomorrow
eevening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some."
      When we  had  finished the work in hand, he said to me,
"And now, frriend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep,
bothh you and I, and  rest to recuperate.  Tomorrow  we shall
have much to ddo, but for the tonight there is no need of us.
Alas!""
     Before  turrning  in we  went to  look at poor Lucy. The
undertakker had  certainly  done his  work well, for the room

was turned into a small chapelle ardente.  There was a wild-
erness  off  beautiful  white  flowers, and death was made as
liittle repulsive as might be.  The  end of the winding sheet
was  laid  oover  the face.  When the Professor bent over and
turnned it gently back,  we both started at the beauty before
us.  The tall  wax candles showing a sufficient light to note
it welll. All Lucy's loveliness had come back to her in death,
and the hours tthat had passed, instead of leaving  traces of
`decay''s effacing fingers', had but  restored  the beauty of
life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was
looking aat a corpse.
      The  Professor  looked sternly grave.  He had not loved
her as  I  had,, and there was no need for tears in his eyes.
He saidd to me, "Remain till I return," and left the room. He
came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting
in the haall, but which had not been opened, and  placed  the
fflowers amongst the others on and  around the  bed.  Then he
took from hhis neck, inside his collar, a  little gold cruci-
fixx, and placed it over the mouth.  He restored the sheet to
its place, annd we came away.
      I was undressing in my own room, when, with a  premoni-
tory tap att the door, he entered, and at once began to speak.
      "Tomorrow I want you to  bring me, before night, a  set
of post-morttem knives."
      "Must we make an autopsy?" I asked.
     "Yes and no. I want to operate, but not what you think.
Let me teell you  now, but not a  word to another.  I want to
ccut off her head and take out her heart.  Ah! You a surgeon,
and so shoccked!  You,  whom  I have  seen with no tremble of
hannd or heart, do operations of life and death that make the
rest shudder..  Oh,  but  I  must  not forget, my dear friend
John,, that you loved her, and I have not forgotten it for is
I that shall opperate, and you must not help. I would like to
do it ttonight, but for Arthur I must not.  He  will  be free
after his father's funeral tomorrow, and he will want to see
her, to ssee it.  Then, when  she is coffined ready  for  the
nnext  day,  you  and  I shall come when all sleep.  We shall
unscrew thee coffin lid, and shall do our operation, and then
repplace all, so that none know, save we alone."
     "Buut why do it at all?  The girl is dead.  Why mutilate

her poor body without need? And if there is no necessity for
a post-morrtem and nothing to  gain by it, no good to her, to
uss, to science, to human knowledge, why do it?  Without such
it is monstrrous."
     For  aanswer  he  put his hand on my shoulder, and said,
witth  infinite  tenderness,  "Friend John,  I pity your poor
bleeding hearrt, and I love you the  more  because it does so
bleedd.  If  I could, I would  take on myself the burden that
you  do bear.   But there are  things that  you know not, but
that yoou shall know, and bless  me for  knowing, though they
are not pleasant things.  John, my child, you  have  been my
friend noow  many years, and  yet did you ever know me to  do
aany  without good cause?  I may err, I am but man, but I be-
lieve  in   all  I  do.  Was it not for these causes that you
sennd for me when the great trouble came?  Yes!  Were you not
amazed, nay hhorrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss  his
love,, though she was dying, and snatched him away by  all my
strength?  Yes!!  And yet you saw how she thanked me,with her
so beauutiful dying eyes, her voice,  too, so  weak, and  she
kiss my rough old hand and bless me?  Yes!  And did  you not
hear me sswear promise to her, that  so  she closed  her eyes
ggrateful?  Yes!
      "Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You
have for manny years trust me.You have believe me weeks past,
whenn there  be  things  so  strange that you might have well
doubt. Believee me yet a little, friend John. If you trust me
not, tthen  I must tell what I think, and that is not perhaps
well.  And if I  work, as work I shall, no matter trust or no
trust,wiithout my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart

and feel, oh so lonely when I want all help and courage that
may be!"   He  paused a moment and  went on solemnly, "Friend
Joohn, there are strange and terrible days before us.  Let us
not be two,  but one, that so we work to a good end. Will you
not  have faith in me?"
     I took his  hand, and promised him.  I held my door open
as he weent away,and watched him go to his room and close the

door. As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass
silently aalong  the  passage, she had her back to me, so did
noot see me, and go into  the room where Lucy lay.  The sight
touched me.   Devotion is so rare, and we  are so grateful to
thosse who show it unasked to those we love.  Here was a poor
girl putting   aside  the terrors  which she naturally had of
death  to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she
loved, so that   the  poor clay might not be lonely till laid
to eternnal rest.
     I   must  have  slept long and soundly, for it was broad

daylight  when  Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room.
He  came oover to  my bedside and said, "You need not trouble
abbout the knives.  We shall not do it."
     "Why not?""  I  asked.  For  his  solemnity of the night
before  had greatly impressed me.
     "Beccause,"  he  said  sternly,  "it is too late, or too
eearly.  See!"  Here he  held  up the little golden crucifix.
     "This  was stolen in the night."
     "Howw stolen,"I asked in wonder,"since you have it now?"
      "Because  I  get  it back from the worthless wretch who
stole it, ffrom the woman who robbed the dead and the living.
Herr  punishment will  surely come,  but not  through me. She
knew not altoogether what  she  did, and  thus unknowing, she
only   stole.  Now we  must wait."  He went away on the word,
leaving me withh a new mystery to think of, a new  puzzle  to
grapplee with.
     The fforenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solici-
toor came, Mr.Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidder-
dale.  He waas very genial and very appreciative  of  what we
had  done, and took off our hands all  cares  as  to details.
During lunch hhe told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time
expectted sudden death from her heart,and had put her affairs
in absolute ordeer.  He informed  us that, with the exception
of a  ceertain  entailed property of Lucy's father which now,

in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of
the  familly, the  whole  estate, real and personal, was left
abbsolutely to  Arthur Holmwood.  When he had told us so much
he went on,,
     "Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary
dispositiion,and pointed out certain contingencies that might
lleave her daughter either penniless or not so  free  as  she
should be tto act regarding a matrimonial  alliance.  Indeed,
we  pressed the matter so far that we almost came into colli-
sion, for shee asked us if we were or  were  not prepared  to
carryy out her wishes.  Of course, we had then no alternative
but to accept.   We were right  in principle, and ninety-nine
times oout of a hundred we should have proved,by the logic of
events, the accuracy of our judgment.
     "Frankly,,  however,  I must admit that in this case any
other  form of disposition would have rendered impossible the
carrying  out off  her  wishes.  For by  her predeceasing her
daughterr the latter would have come into possession  of  the

property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five
minutes, hher property would, in case there were no will, and
a  will was a practical impossibility in such  a  case,  have
been treatedd at her decease  as  under intestacy.  In  which
casee Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had
no  claim in   the  world.  And the inheritors, being remote,
would  not be likely to abandon their just rights, for senti-
mental reasons rregarding an entire stranger.  I assure  you,
my dear  sirs,I am rejoiced at the result,perfectly rejoiced."
     He was  a  good  fellow,  but his  rejoicing at the one
little  ppart, in  which he  was officially interested, of so
ggreat a tragedy, was  an object-lesson in the limitations of
sympatheticc understanding.
      He did not remain long, but said he would look in later
in the day  and see Lord Godalming.  His coming, however, had
beeen  a  certain  comfort to us, since it assured us that we
should not haave to dread  hostile criticism as to any of our
acts..Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so a little before
that  time we vvisited  the death chamber.  It was so in very
truth,  for now both mother and daughter lay in it.The under-
taker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could
of his gooods, and there was a  mortuary air about  the place
tthat lowered our spirits at once.
      Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adher-
ed to,  expllaining  that, as  Lord Godalming was coming very
soonn, it would  be less harrowing to his feelings to see all
that was left  of his fiancee quite alone.
     Thhe  undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
exerted himself to  restore things to the condition in which
we left tthem the night before, so that when Arthur came such
sshocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved.
      Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken. Even
his stalwarrt  manhood  seemed  to have shrunk somewhat under
thee strain of his much-tried emotions.  He had, I knew, been
very  genuineely and devotedly attached to his father, and to
lose  him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him. With
me  he was  warrm as  ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly
courteoous.  But I could  not help seeing that there was some
constraint with  him.  The  professor  noticed  it  too, and
motioned  me to bring him upstairs.  I did  so, and  left him
aat  the  door  of  the  room,  as I felt he would like to be
quite alonee with her, but he took my arm and led me in, say-
ingg huskily,
     "YYou loved her too,  old fellow.  She told me all about
it, and there was no friend  had a closer place in her heart
than you..  I don't know  how to  thank  you for all you have
ddone for her.  I can't think yet . . ."
     Here  he  suddenly broke  down, and threw his arms round
my shooulders  and  laid  his head on my breast, crying, "Oh,
Jack!  Jack!  Whhat shall I do?  The whole of life seems gone
from me  all at once, and there is  nothing in the wide world

for me to live for."
     I comfortted him  as well as I could.  In such cases men
do nott need much expression.  A grip of the hand, the tight-
ening of an arm  over the shoulder, a sob in unison,  are ex-
pressionns of sympathy dear to a man's heart.  I stood  still

and silent till his sobs died away,and then I said softly to
him, "Comee and look at her."
     Together wee moved over to the bed,and I lifted the lawn
from herr face. God!  How beautiful she was. Every hour seem-

ed to be enhancing her loveliness.  It frightened and amazed
me somewhaat.  And as for Arthur, he fell to  trembling,  and
fiinally was shaken with doubt as with an ague.At last, after
a long pausee, he said to me in a faint whisper,"Jack, is she
reallly dead?"
     I  assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to sug-
gest, for  I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have
life for  a  moment  longer than  I could help, that it often
hhappened that  after death  faces  become  softened and even
resolved innto their youthful beauty,that this was especially
so  when death had been preceded by any  acute  or  prolonged
suffering. I  seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and af-
ter kkneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her
lovingly and loong, he turned aside.I told him that that must
be gooddbye, as the coffin had to be prepared,so he went back
and took her dead hand in  his  and kissed it, and bent over
and kisseed her forehead.  He came away,  fondly looking back
oover his shoulder at her as he came.
     I  left  him in  the drawing room, and told Van Helsing
that he hhad said goodbye, so the latter went to the  kitchen
tto  tell  the  undertaker's men to proceed with the prepera-
tions and tto screw up the coffin.  When  he came out of  the
rooom again I told him of Arthur's question, and he  replied,
"I am not surrprised.Just now I doubted for a moment myself!"
      We  all  dined  together, and I could see that poor Art
was trying to mmake the best of things.  Van Helsing had been
silent  all dinner time, but when we had lit  our  cigars  he
said, "Lord . . ., but Arthur interrupted him.
      "No, no, not that, for God's sake!  Not yet at any rate.
Forgive me, siir.  I did not mean to speak offensively. It is
only bbecause my loss is so recent."
      The  Professor answered very sweetly, "I only used that
name because  II was in doubt.  I must not call you `Mr.' and
I have  grown to love you,  yes, my dear boy, to love you, as
Arthur."
     Arrthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.
"Call me what yoou will," he said.  "I hope I may always have
the titlle  of a  friend.  And let me say that I am at a loss

for words to  thank  you for your goodness to my poor dear."
He paused  a moment, and went on, "I know that she understood
yoour goodness even better than I do. And if I was rude or in
any way  wannting at that time you acted so, you remember,"--
the  Professor nodded--"You must forgive me."
     He  ansswered with a grave kindness, "I know it was hard
for  you to  quite trust  me then, for to trust such violence
needs to underrstand, and I take it that you do not, that you
cannott, trust me now, for you  do not  yet  understand.  And
there may be morre times when I shall want you to  trust when
you cannnot, and may not, and must not yet understand.But the

time will come when your trust shall be whole  and  complete
in me, andd when you shall  understand as though the sunlight
hiimself shone through. Then you shall bless me from first to
last for youur own sake, and for the sake of  others, and for
her  dear sake to whom I swore to protect."
     "And indeeed, indeed, sir," said Arthur warmly. "I shall
in alll ways trust you.  I know and believe you  have a  very
noble  heart,  aand you are Jack's friend, and you were hers.
You shalll do what you like."
     The Profeessor  cleared his throat a couple of times, as
thoughh  about  to  speak, and  finally said,  "May I ask you
something now?""
     "Certainly."
     "You know tthat Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?"
     "NNo, poor dear.  I never thought of it."
     "And as iit is all yours,  you have a right to deal with
it as  you will. I want you to give me permission to read all
Miss  Lucy's pappers and  letters.  Believe me, it is no idle
curiositty. I have a motive of which, be sure, she would have

approved.  I have them all here.  I took them before we knew
that all wwas yours, so that no strange hand might touch them,
nno  strange  eye  look through words into her soul.  I shall
keep them,  if I may.  Even  you may  not see them yet, but I
shaall keep them  safe.  No  word shall  be  lost, and in the
good time I sshall give them back to you.  It is a hard thing
that  I  ask,  but you  will do  it, will you not, for Lucy's
sake?"
     ArArthur spoke out heartily,  like his old self, "Dr. Van
Helsing,  you  may do what  you will.  I feel that in saying
this I  aam  doing what  my dear  one would have approved.  I
sshall not trouble you with questions till the time comes."
     The old  Professor stood up as he said solemnly,"And you
are rright. There will be pain for us all, but it will not be
all pain, nor wwill this pain be the last.We and you too, you
most off all, dear boy, will have to pass through  the bitter
water before we  reach the sweet.  But  we must  be brave of
heart andd unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well!"
      I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Hel-
sing did noot go to bed at all.  He went  to and  fro, as  if
pattroling the house, and was never  out of sight of the room
where  Lucy   lay  in her coffin, strewn with the wild garlic
floweers,  which  sent  through the  odor of lily and rose, a
heavy, overpoweering smell into the night.

  MINANA HARKER'S JOURNAL

     22 Septembber.--In the train to Exeter.  Jonathan sleep-
ing.  IIt  seems only yesterday that the last entry was made,
and yet how  much  between then, in Whitby and all the world
before mee, Jonathan away  and no news of him, and now, marr-
iied to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, mas-
ter of his  business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and  Jona-
thaan with another attack that may harm him.  Some day he may
ask me about  it.  Down it all goes.  I am rusty in my short-
hand,, see what unexpected prosperity does for us, so  it may
be as well to ffreshen it up again with an exercise anyhow.
     The  service was very simple and very solemn. There were
oonly ourselves and the servants there,one or two old friends
of his fromm Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman repre-
sennting Sir John Paxton, the President  of the  Incorporated
Law Society.   Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt
that  our best and dearest friend was gone from us.
     Wee came back to town quietly, taking a bus to Hyde Park
Corner.  Jonathan thought it would interest me  to  go  into
the Row ffor a while, so we sat  down.  But  there were  very
ffew people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see
so many emppty chairs. It made us think of the empty chair at
homme.  So we got up and walked down Piccadilly. Jonathan was
holding me byy the arm, the way he used to in  the  old  days
beforre I went to school.  I felt it  very  improper, for you
can't go on forr some years teaching etiquette and decorum to
other ggirls without the pedantry  of it biting into yourself
a bit.  But it was Jonathan,  and he was  my husband, and we
didn't knnow anybody who saw us,  and we didn't  care if they
ddid, so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl,
in a big ccart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guil-
iaano's, when I felt  Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he
hurt me, andd he said under his breath, "My God!"
     I am  alwayys  anxious about  Jonathan,  for I fear that
some nerrvous fit may upset him again.  So  I  turned  to him

quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.
     He was  verry  pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as,
half in   terror and  half  in amazement, he gazed at a tall,

thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache  and pointed
beard, whoo was also observing the pretty girl.He was looking
att her so hard that he did not see either of us,and so I had
a good view  of him.  His face was not a  good  face.  It was
hardd, and cruel,and sensual,and big white teeth, that looked
all the whiterr because his lips were so  red,  were  pointed
like aan animal's.  Jonathan kept staring  at him, till I was
afraid he would  notice.  I feared  he  might take it ill, he
looked sso fierce and nasty. I asked Jonathan why he was dis-

turbed, and he answered, evidently  thinking that  I knew as
much aboutt it as he did, "Do you see who it is?"
     "No, dearr," I said.  "I don't know him, who is it?"
His answerr seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as
iff  he  did  not  know  that it was me, Mina, to whom he was
speaking.  ""It is the man himself!"
     The pooor dear was evidently terrified at something,very
greeatly terrified.  I do believe that if he had not  had  me
to lean on annd to support him  he would have sunk  down.  He
kept  staring. A man came out of the shop with a small parcel,
and gave it too the lady, who then drove off.  Th e dark  man
kept hhis eyes fixed on her, and when  the carriage  moved up
Piccadilly he foollowed in the  same direction,  and hailed a
hansom.   Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to

himself,
     "I  believe it is the Count, but he has grown young.  My

God, if this be so! Oh, my God!  My God! If only I knew!  If
only I kneew!" He was distressing himself so much that I fear-
eed to keep  his  mind  on the subject by asking him any ques-
tions, so  I  remained silent.  I  drew away quietly, and he,
hoolding my arm, came easily. We walked a little further, and
then went inn  and sat for a while in the Green Park.  It was
a hoot day for autumn, and there  was a comfortable seat in a
shady place.   After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jona-
than'ss eyes closed, and  he  went quickly into a sleep, with
his head on my sshoulder. I thought it was the best thing for
him, so  did not disturb him. In about twenty minutes he woke

up, and  said to me quite cheerfully,
     "Why,  Minna, have I been asleep!  Oh, do forgive me for
being sso rude. Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere."
     He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger,
as in hiss  illness  he  had  forgotten all that this episode
hhad reminded him of.  I don't like this lapsing into forget-
fulness.  IIt may  make or continue some injury to the brain.
I mmust not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good,
but I must soomehow learn the facts of his journey abroad.The
time  is  come, I fear, when I must open the parcel, and know
what is writtenn.  Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me
if I doo wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.

     Lateter.--A sad home-coming in every way, the house empty
oof the dear soul who was so good to us.  Jonathan still pale
and  dizzy   under  a slight relapse of his malady, and now a
tellegram from Van Helsing,  whoever he may be.  "You will be
grieved to  hhear that  Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
that   Lucy died  the day  before  yesterday.  They were both
buried today.""
     Oh,  what a wealth of sorrow in a few words!  Poor Mrs.
Westenra!!   Poor Lucy!   Gone,  gone, never to return to us!
AAnd poor, poor Arthur, to have lost such  a sweetness out of
his life!   God help us all to bear our troubles.

         DR. . SEWARD'S DIARY-CONT.

     22 Septptember.--It is all over.  Arthur has gone back to
Ringg, and   has  taken Quincey Morris with him.  What a fine
fellow is Quinncey!  I believe in  my heart of hearts that he
sufferred as much about Lucy's death as any of us,but he bore
himself through  it like a moral Viking. If America can go on
breedingg men like that, she will be a power in the world in-

deed.  Van Helsing is lying down, having a  rest preparatory
to his jouurney.  He goes to Amsterdam  tonight,  but says he
reeturns tomorrow night,  that  he  only wants  to  make some
arrangementss which can only be made  personally.  He  is  to
stopp with me then, if he can.  He says  he has work to do in
London which mmay take him some time. Poor old fellow! I fear
that tthe strain of the  past  week  has broken down even his
iron strength.Alll the time of the burial he was, I could see,
puttingg some terrible restraint on himself.  When it was all
over, we  were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was
speaking   of  his part in  the operation where his blood had
bbeen  transfused  to his Lucy's veins.  I could see Van Hel-
sing's  facce  grow white and  purple  by  turns.  Arthur was
sayying  that he  felt  since then  as  if they  two had been
really marrieed,and that she was his wife in the sight of God.
Nonee of us  said a word of the other operations, and none of
us ever shall..  Arthur and Quincey went away together to the
statioon,  and Van Helsing and I came on here.  The moment we
were alone in thhe carriage he  gave way to  a regular fit of
hystericcs.  He has denied to me since that it was hysterics,

and insisted that it was only his  sense  of humor asserting
itself undder very terrible  conditions.  He laughed till  he
crried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should
see us and mmisjudge.And then he cried, till he laughed again,
andd laughed and cried together, just as a woman does.I tried
to be stern wwith him, as one is to a woman under the circum-
stancces, but it had no effect.Men and women are so different
in manifestatioons of nervous strength or weakness! Then when
his  faace  grew  grave  and stern  again I asked him why his
mirth, and why at such a time.  His reply was in a way char-
acteristiic of him, for it  was logical and forceful and mys-
tterious.  He said,
     "Ah, you don't  comprehend,  friend John.  Do not think
that I amm not sad, though I laugh.  See, I  have  cried even
wwhen the laugh did choke me. But no more think that I am all
sorry when  I cry, for the laugh he come just the same.  Keep
it  always with you that laughter who knock at your  door and
say, `May I ccome in?' is not true laughter. No! He is a king,
and  he come when and how he like.He ask no person, he choose
no time of suiitability.  He say, `I am here.' Behold, in ex-
ample  I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl.  I
give my blood foor her,though I am  old and  worn.  I give my
time, myy skill, my sleep. I let my other sufferers want that

she may have all.  And yet I  can  laugh at  her very grave,
laugh whenn the clay from the spade of  the sexton  drop upon
heer coffin and say `Thud, thud!'  to my heart, till it  send
back the bloood from my  cheek.  My heart bleed for that poor
boy,, that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been
so blessed thaat he live, and with his hair and eyes the same.
      "There, you  know  now why I love him so.  And yet when
he say things tthat touch my husband-heart  to the quick, and
make myy  father-heart yearn to  him  as to no other man, not
even you, friend John, for we are more  level in experiences
than fathher and son, yet even at such a moment King Laugh he
ccome to me and shout and bellow in my ear,`Here I am! Here I
am!' till tthe blood come dance back  and bring some  of  the
sunnshine that he carry with him to my cheek.Oh, friend John,
it is a strannge world, a sad world,a world full of miseries,
and wwoes, and troubles.And yet when King Laugh come, he make
them all dance  to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry
bones oof the churchyard, and tears that  burn  as they fall,
all dance together to the music that he make with that smile-
less mouuth of him.  And believe me,  friend John, that he is

good to come, and kind.  Ah, we men and women are like ropes
drawn tighht with strain that pull  us different  ways.  Then
teears come, and like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up,
until perhaaps the strain become too great, and we break. But
Kinng Laugh he come like  the  sunshine,  and he ease off the
strain again,, and we bear  to go  on with our labor, what it
may bbe."
     I  did   not  like to wound him by pretending not to see
his iidea,  but  as I did not yet understand the cause of his
laughter, I  assked him.  As he  answered  me  his  face grew
stern,  and he said in quite a different tone,
     "Oh,it waas the grim irony of it all,this so lovely lady
garlannded with flowers,that looked so fair as life, till one
by one we wonderred if she  were truly dead, she laid in that
so fine  marble house in that lonely churchyard,where rest so

many of her kin, laid  there with  the mother who loved her,
and whom sshe loved, and that sacred bell going "Toll!  Toll!
Tooll!'  so sad  and slow, and those holy men, with the white
garments of  the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all
the  time their eyes never on the page,and all of us with the
bowed head. Annd all for what?  She is dead, so!  Is it not?"
     ""Well, for the life of me, Professor," I said, "I can't
see anything to  laugh  at in all that.  Why, your expression
makes itt a harder puzzle than before. But even if the burial

service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble?  Why
his heart  was simply breaking."
     "Just soo. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood
to heer veins had made her truly his bride?"
     "Yes, andd it was a sweet and comforting idea for him."
     "QQuite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John.  If
so that, then what  about the others?  Ho, ho!  Then this so
sweet maiid is a polyandrist,and me,with my poor wife dead to
mme, but alive by Church's law,though no wits, all gone, even
I, who am ffaithful husband to this now-no-wife,am bigamist."
      "I don't see where the joke comes in there  either!"  I
said, and I ddid not feel particularly  pleased  with him for
sayinng such things.  He laid his hand on my arm, and said,
     "Friend  John, forgive  me if  I pain.  I showed not my
feeling tto others when it would wound,  but only  to you, my
oold friend, whom I can trust.  If you could have looked  in-
to my heartt then when I want to laugh,if you could have done
so  when the laugh arrived, if you could do so now, when King
Laugh have paack up his crown, and all that is to him, for he
go faar, far away from me, and for a  long, long  time, maybe
you would perhaaps pity me the most of all."
     II was touched  by the tenderness of his tone, and asked
why.
     "Becacause I know!"
      And  now we are all scattered,  and for many a long day
loneliness willl sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy
lies iin the tomb of her kin,a lordly death house in a lonely
churchyard, awayy from teeming London, where the air is fresh,
and thee sun rises over Hampstead Hill,and where wild flowers
grow of their own accord.
     So   I  can  finish  this diary, and God only knows if I

shall ever begin  another.  If I do,  or if I even open this
again, it   will be to deal with different people and differ-
ennt themes,for here at the end, where the romance of my life
is told, eree I go back to take up the thread of my life-work,
I ssay sadly and without hope, "FINIS".

  THE WESTMINSTTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER
 A HAMPSTEEAD MYSTERY

       The  neighborhood of Hampstead is just at present exer-
cised with  a   series  of events  which seem to run on lines
paralllel to those of what was known to the writers of  head-
lines and "The KKensington Horror," or "The Stabbing  Woman,"
or "The  Woman in Black." During the past  two or  three days

several cases have occurred of young children  straying from
home or neeglecting to return from their playing on the Heath.
IIn all these cases the children  were  too young to give any
properly inntelligible account of themselves, but the consen-
suss of their excuses is  that they  had been with a "bloofer
lady." It hass always been late in the evening when they have
been  missed, and on two occasions the children have not been
found until earrly in the following morning.  It is generally
supposeed in the neighborhood that, as the first child missed
gave as his reason for being  away that a "bloofer lady" had
asked himm to come for a walk,the  others  had  picked up the
pphrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more nat-
ural as thee favorite game of  the  little ones at present is
lurring each other away by wiles.  A  correspondent writes us
that to see ssome of the tiny tots pretending to be the"bloo-
fer llady" is supremely funny.Some of our caricaturists might,
he says,take aa lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing
the reeality  and the picture.  It is only in accordance with
general principlles  of  human nature that the "bloofer lady"
should bbe  the popular role at these al fresco performances.

Our correspondent  naively  says that even Ellen Terry could
not be so  winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced
liittle children pretend, and even imagine themselves, to be.
     There iis, however, possibly a serious side to the ques-
tionn,  for  some  of  the children, indeed all who have been
missed at nighht, have  been  slightly torn or wounded in the
throatt.  The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a
small dog, and aalthough of not much importance individually,
would teend to show that whatever  animal inflicts them has a

system or method of  its own.  The  police  of  the division
have  beenn  instructed  to keep a sharp lookout for straying
chhildren, especially  when very  young, in  and around Hamp-
stead Heath,, and for any stray dog which may be about.

     We hahave just received  intelligence that another child,
miissed last  night,  was only discovered late in the morning
under a furzze bush at  the  Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead
Heatth, which is perhaps,less frequented than the other parts.
It has the saame tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed
in otther cases.  It was terribly weak, and looked quite ema-

to telll of being lured away by the "bloofer lady".


CHAPTAPTER 14

                    MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

       23 September.--Jonathan is better  after a bad night. I
am so  glad  that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps
his  mind off the terrible things, and oh, I am rejoiced that
he is not  noww weighed  down  with the responsibility of his
new poosition.  I  knew he  would be true to himself, and now
how proud  I  amm to see  my Jonathan rising to the height of
his advaancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties

that come upon him.  He  will be away all day till late, for
he  said hhe  could not lunch at  home.  My household work is
doone, so I shall take his  foreign  journal, and lock myself
up in my rooom and read it.


     24 September.--I hadn't  the heart to write last night,
that terriible record of  Jonathan's upset me so.  Poor dear!
Hoow he must have suffered,  whether it be true or only imag-
ination.  I  wonder if there is  any truth in it at all.  Did
he   get his  brain fever,  and then write all those terrible
things,  or haad he some cause for it all?  I suppose I shall
never  know, for I dare not open the subject to him.  And yet
that man we saw  yesterday!  He seemed quite certain of  him,
poor felllow! I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent

his mind back on some train of thought.
     He belieeves it all himself. I remember how on our wedd-
ing dday he said "Unless some solemn duty come upon me to  go
back to the bittter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane . . ."
There  seems to be through it all some thread of  continuity.
That fearful Couunt was coming  to London.  If it should  be,
and he ccame to London, with its teeming millions . . . There

may be a solemn duty, and if it come we must not shrink from
it. I shalll be prepared. I shall get my typewriter this very
hoour and begin transcribing.Then we shall be ready for other
eyes if requuired.  And if it be wanted, then,  perhaps, if I
am rready, poor Jonathan may not be upset,for I can speak for
him and never  let him be troubled or worried with it at all.
If eveer Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want
to tell me of itt all, and  I can ask him  questions and find
out thinngs, and see how I may comfort him.

"
"Dear Madam,
      "I pray  you  to pardon my writing, in that I am so far
friend as that  I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's
death..  By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I am empowered to
read her letterss and papers, for I am deeply concerned about
certain   matters  vitally  important.  In  them  I find some

letters from you, which show how great friends  you were and
how you loove her.  Oh, Madam Mina, by that  love, I  implore
yoou, help me.  It is for others' good that I ask, to redress
great wrong,, and to  lift much  and  terrible troubles, that
may   be  more great than you can know.  May it be that I see
you?  You  cann trust me.  I am friend of Dr. John Seward and
of Lorrd Godalming  (that was  Arthur of Miss Lucy).  I  must
keep it private  for the present  from all.  I should come to
Exeter tto see you at  once if you  tell me I am privilege to

come, and where and when.  I implore  your pardon, Madam.  I
have read  your  letters to  poor Lucy, and know how good you
arre and how your husband suffer.  So  I  pray you, if it may
be, enlighteen him not, least it may harm. Again your pardon,
and  forgive me.

 MINA HARKER'S JJOURNAL

     25 5 September.--I  cannot  help feeling terribly excited

as the time draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for
somehow  II  expect  that it will throw some light upon Jona-
thhan's sad experience,  and as he attended poor dear Lucy in
her last illlness, he can tell me all about her.  That is the
reasson of his coming.  It  is concerning Lucy and her sleep-
walking, and   not  about  Jonathan.  Then I shall never know
the reeal truth now!  How silly I am. That awful journal gets
hold of my imagiination and tinges everything with  something
of its oown color.  Of course it is about  Lucy.  That  habit

came back to the poor dear,and that awful night on the cliff
must have  made her ill.  I had almost forgotten  in  my  own
afffairs how ill she was afterwards.  She must  have told him
of her sleepp-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew
all  about it, and now he wants me to tell him what I know,so
that he may unnderstand.  I hope I did  right  in  not saying
anythiing of it to Mrs. Westenra.  I should never forgive my-
self if any act  of mine, were it even a negative one,brought
harm on  poor dear Lucy.  I hope too,Dr. Van Helsing will not

blame me.  I have had so much  trouble  and anxiety of  late
that I feeel I cannot bear more just at present.
     I suppose   a  cry does us all good at times, clears the
air as  other  rain does.  Perhaps it was reading the journal
yesterday that  upset  me, and then  Jonathan went away this
morning tto stay away from me a whole day and night,the first
ttime we have been parted since our marriage.  I do  hope the
dear felloww will take care of himself, and that nothing will
occcur to upset him.  It is two  o'clock, and the doctor will
be here soon  now.  I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal
unlesss he asks me.  I am so glad  I  have typewritten out my
own journal, soo that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand
it to hhim.  It will save much questioning.
     Later.--He has come and gone.  Oh, what a strange meet-
ing, and   how it all makes my head whirl round.  I feel like
oone in a dream.Can it be all possible, or even a part of it?
If I had  nnot read Jonathan's  journal first, I should never
havve accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear Jonathan!
How he must hhave suffered. Please the good God, all this may
not uupset him again.  I shall  try to save him from it.  But
it may be even   a  consolation and  a  help to him, terrible
though  it be and awful in its consequences, to know for cer-
tain that his eyes and ears and brain  did not deceive  him,
and that  it is all true.It may be that it is the doubt which
hhaunts him, that when the doubt is removed, no matter which,
waking  or   dreaming, may prove  the  truth, he will be more
sattisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing
must be a goood man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's
friennd and Dr. Seward's, and if they brought him all the way
from Holland too look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him
that hee  is  good  and  kind and of a noble nature.  When he
comes  tomorrow  I shall  ask him about Jonathan.  And then,
please Good, all this sorrow  and  anxiety may lead to a good
eend.  I used to think I would like to practice interviewing.
Jonathan's  friend on "The Exeter News"  told him that memory
is   everything  in  such work,  that you must be able to put
down  exactlyy almost every  word spoken, even if  you had to
refinne some of it afterwards.  Here was a rare interview.  I
shall  try to rrecord it verbatim.
     It  was  haalf-past  two o'clock when the knock came.  I
took my  courage  a  deux mains and waited.  In a few minutes

Mary opened the door, and announced "Dr. Van Helsing".
     I rose and  bowed, and he came towards me, a man of med-
ium weigght, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over

a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as
the head iis on the neck. The poise of the head strikes me at
onnce as indicative of thought and power.  The head is noble,
well-sized,  broad, and large behind the ears.The face, clean-
shaaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large  resolute, mobile
mouth, a goodd-sized nose, rather straight, but  with  quick,
sensiitive nostrils, that seem  to broaden as  the  big bushy
brows come downn and the mouth tightens.The forehead is broad
and finne, rising at first almost straight  and  then sloping
back above two bumps or ridges wide apart, such  a  forehead
that the  reddish hair cannot possibly  tumble  over it,  but
ffalls naturally back and to the sides.  Big, dark  blue eyes
are set widdely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with
thee man's moods.  He said to me,
      "Mrs. Harker, is it not?"  I bowed assent.
     "Thatt was Miss Mina Murray?"  Again I assented.
     "It   is  Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend
off that poor dear child Lucy Westenra.  Madam Mina, it is on
account of tthe dead that I come."
     "Sir,"   I  said,  "you could have no better claim on me
than  that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra."And
I held out my hhand.  He took it and said tenderly,
     "Oh,  Madam  Mina,  I know that the friend of that poor
little giirl must be good, but I had yet to learn . . ."   He
ffinished his speech with a courtly bow.  I asked him what it
was that hee wanted to see me about, so he at once began.
     "II have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but
I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and  there  was none to
ask.  I kknow that you were with her at Whitby. She sometimes
kkept a diary, you need not look surprised,  Madam  Mina.  It
was begun aafter you had left, and was  an  imitation of you,
andd in that diary she traces by  inference certain things to
a sleep-walkiing in which she puts down that you saved her.In
greatt perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your
so much kindnesss to tell me all of it that you can remember."
     ""I  can  tell  you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about
it."
     "Ah, ,  then you have good memory for facts, for details?
Itt is not always so with young ladies."
     "No, doctoor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can
show itt to you if you like."
     "Oh, Maddam Mina, I well be grateful.You will do me much
favorr."
     I could   not  resist the temptation of mystifying him a
bit,   I  suppose it is some taste of the original apple that
remains still  iin  our mouths, so I handed him the shorthand
diary. HHe took it with a grateful bow, and said, "May I read

it?"
     "If  yoou  wish," I answered as demurely as I could.  He
openned it, and  for an instant his face fell.  Then he stood
up and bowed..
     "Oh, you so clever woman!"  he said.  "I knew long that
Mr. Jonatthan  was  a  man of much thankfulness, but see, his
wwife have all the good things.And will you not so much honor
me and so hhelp me as to read it  for  me?  Alas!  I know not
thee shorthand."
      By this  time my little joke was over, and I was almost
ashamed.  So II took the typewritten copy from my work basket
and haanded it to him.
      "Forgive me,"  I said.  "I could not help it, but I had
been thinkiing  that it  was of  dear Lucy that you wished to
askk, and so that you might not have  time to wait, not on my
account, but  because  I  know  your time must be precious, I
have  written it out on the typewriter for you."
     He toook it and his  eyes glistened.  "You are so good,"
hee said.  "And may I read it now? I may want to ask you some
things when  I have read."
      "By all means,"  I  said.  "read it over whilst I order
lunch, and thhen you can ask me questions whilst we eat."
     He bbowed and settled  himself  in a chair with his back
tto the light, and became so absorbed in the papers, whilst I
went  to  ssee after lunch chiefly in order that he might not
be  disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurried-
ly up and dowwn the room, his face all ablaze with excitement.
He rrushed up to me and took me by both hands.
     "Oh, MMadam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to
youu?  This paper is as sunshine.  It opens the gate to me. I
am dazed,  I   am dazzled, with so much light, and yet clouds
roll   in  behind the light every time.  But that you do not,
cannot  comprehhend.  Oh,  but  I  am grateful to you, you so
clever  woman.  Madame," he said this very solemnly, "if ever
Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours,I trust
you will  let me know.  It will be pleasure and  delight if I
mmay serve you as a friend, as a friend, but  all I have ever
learned, alll I can ever do, shall be for  you  and those you
lovve.  There are darknesses in life, and  there  are lights.
You are one oof the lights.  You will have a happy life and a
good  life, and your husband will be  blessed in you."
      "But,  doctor,  you praise me too much,  and you do not
know me."
       "Not know you,  I, who am old, and who have studied all
my life  men   and  women,  I who  have made my specialty the
brainn and all that belongs to  him  and all that follow from
him!  And  I  hhave read  your diary that  you have so goodly
writtenn for me, and which breathes out  truth in every line.
I, who have read your so sweet letter to  poor Lucy  of your
marriage  and your trust, not know you!  Oh, Madam Mina, good
wwomen tell all their lives, and  by day and by hour  and  by
minute,  suuch things that angels can  read.  And  we men who
wissh to know have  in  us  something of  angels' eyes.  Your
husband is  nnoble nature, and  you  are noble  too,  for you
trustt, and trust cannot be where there is  mean nature.  And
your  husband,  tell  me  of  him.  Is he quite well?  Is all
that feever gone, and is he strong and hearty?"
     I saw heere  an  opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I
said,,"He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset
by Mr. Hawkins  death."
     He iinterrupted, "Oh, yes. I know.  I know.  I have read
yyour last two letters."
     I went  on,  "I suppose this upset him, for when we were
in ttown on Thursday last he had a sort of shock."
     "AA shock,  and after  brain fever so soon!  That is not
good.  What kind of shock was it?"
     "He  thought  he  saw  some one who  recalled something
terrible,, something which led to his brain fever."  And here
tthe whole thing seemed to overwhelm me  in a rush.  The pity
for Jonathaan,  the  horror  which he  experienced, the whole
feaarful mystery  of his  diary, and  the  fear that has been
brooding overr me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose
I wass hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up
my  hands  to   him, and implored him to make my husband well
again.   He took  my hands  and raised me up, and made me sit
on the sofa, and sat by me. He held my hand in his, and said
to me witth, oh, such infinite sweetness,
      "My life is a barren and lonely one,and so full of work
that I  have   not had much time for friendships, but since I
have  been  summoned  to here by my friend John Seward I have
known so many ggood people and seen such nobility that I feel
more thhan  ever,  and  it has grown with my advancing years,
the  loneliness of my life.  Believe  me,  then, that I come
here fulll  of  respect  for you, and you have given me hope,
hhope, not in what I am seeking  of,  but that there are good
women stilll left to make life happy, good women, whose lives
andd whose truths may make good lesson for the children  that
are to be.  II am glad, glad, that I may here be  of some use
to yoou.  For if  your husband suffer,  he suffer within  the
range of my stuudy and experience.  I promise you that I will
gladly  do all for him that I can,all to make his life strong
and manly, and your life a happy one. Now  you must eat. You
are over--wrought and perhaps over-anxious.  Husband Jonathan
wwould not like to see you so pale,and what he like not where
he love, iss not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must
eatt and smile.  You have told me about  Lucy,  and so now we
shall not speeak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Ex-
eter  tonight, for I want to think much  over  what  you have
told me, and whhen I have thought I will ask you questions,if
I may.   And then too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan's
trouble so far as you can, but not yet.  You  must  eat now,
afterwardds you shall tell me all."
     Afteer lunch,  when we went back to the drawing room, he
ssaid to me, "And now tell me all about him."
     Whenn it came  to  speaking to this great learned man, I
bbegan to fear that he would  think me a weak fool, and Jona-
than a madmman, that journal is  all  so strange, and I hesi-
tatted to  go  on.  But  he was so sweet and kind, and he had
promised to hhelp, and I trusted him, so I said,

     "Dr. Van Helsing,  what  I have to tell you is so queer
that you mmust not laugh at me or at my husband.  I have been
siince  yesterday  in  a sort of fever of doubt.  You must be
kind to me,  and not think  me  foolish that I have even half
beliieved some very strange things."
      He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when
he said, "Oh,, my dear, if  you  only know how strange is the
matteer regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh.
I have learned  not to think  little  of any one's belief, no
matter  how strange it may be.  I have  tried to keep an open
mind, and it is not the ordinary things of  life that  could
close it,, but the strange things, the extraordinary  things,
tthe things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane."
     "Thank you,, thank you a thousand times!  You have taken
a weightt off my mind.  If you will let me, I shall  give you

a paper to read.  It is long, but I have typewritten it out.
It will teell you my trouble and Jonathan's.It is the copy of
hiis journal when abroad, and all that  happened.  I dare not
say anythingg of it.  You will read  for  yourself and judge.
And  then when I see you, perhaps, you will  be very kind and
tell me what yyou think."
     ""I promise," he said as I gave him the papers. "I shall
in the morning,  as  soon as  I can, come to see you and your
husband,, if I may."
      "Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven,and you must
come to lunch wwith us and see him then.  You could catch the
quick 33:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington  before
eight."  He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains off-
hand,but  he does not know that I have made up all the trains
tto and from Exeter,so that I may help Jonathan in case he is
in a hurry..
     So he took  the papers with him and went away, and I sit
here thiinking, thinking I don't know what.

         25 September, 6 o'clock

"Dear r Madam Mina,
      "I have read your husband's so wonderful diary. You may
sleep without ddoubt.  Strange and terrible as it  is, it  is
true! II will pledge my life on it.It may be worse for others,
but for him and  you there is no dread.  He is a noble fellow,
and lett  me  tell  you  from experience of men, that one who
would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room,
aye, and  going  a  second  time, is not one to be injured in
ppermanence by a shock.His brain and his heart are all right,
this I sweaar, before I have even seen him, so be at rest.  I
shaall have much to ask him of other things.I am blessed that
today I come  to see you,for I have learn all at once so much
that  again I am  dazzled, dazzled more than ever, and I must
think.

     LETTER, MRSS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING

       2525 September, 6:30 p.m.

"My dear DrDr. Van Helsing,
      "A thousand thanks for your kind letter,which has taken
a great  weiight off  my  mind.  And yet, if it be true, what
terrrible things there  are  in the  world, and what an awful
thing if that  man, that monster, be really in London! I fear
to thiink.  I have this moment, whilst writing,  had  a  wire
from Jonathan,saaying that he leaves by the 6:25 tonight from
Launcestton and will be here at 10:18,so that I shall have no

fear tonight.  Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with
us, pleasee come to breakfast at eight o'clock,if this be not
tooo early for you?  You can get away, if you are in a hurry,
by the 10:300 train, which  will bring you  to  Paddington by
2:355.  Do not answer this, as  I shall take it that, if I do
not hear, you  will come to breakfast.
     "Belieeve me,
     "Yourr faithful and grateful friend,
      "Mina Harker."


         JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

     26 Septembber.--I  thought never  to write in this diary
again,  but the  time has come.  When  I  got home last night
Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of
Van Helsiing's  visit, and  of  her having given him the  two
ddiaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me.
She showedd me in the doctor's letter that all  I  wrote down
waas true.  It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the
doubt as to  the reality of the whole  thing  that knocked me
overr. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But,
now that I knnow, I am not afraid, even of the Count.  He has
succeeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to Lond-
on, and it was  he I saw.  He  has got younger, and how?  Van
Helsingg is the man  to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is
anything like  what Mina  says.  We  sat late, and talked it
over.  Miina is dressing, and I shall call  at the hotel in a
ffew minutes and bring him over.

       He was, I think, surprised to see me.  When I came into
the room wheee he was, and introduced myself,  he  took me by
the  shoulder,  and  turned  my face  round to the light, and
said, after a  sharp scrutiny,
      "But Madam Mina told me  you were ill, that you had had
a shock."

     It was so funny to hear my wife called  `Madam Mina' by
this kindlly, strong-faced old man.  I smiled,  and  said, "I
waas ill, I have had a shock, but you have cured me already."
     "And hoow?"
     "By yourr letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and
then  everything took a hue of unreality, and  I did not know
what to trust,  even the evidence of my own senses. Not know-
ing whaat to trust, I did not know what to do,and so had only
to keep on working in what had hitherto been  the  groove of
my life.   The  groove ceased  to  avail me, and I mistrusted
mmyself.Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything,
even  yourrself.  No,  you don't, you  couldn't with eyebrows
liike yours."
     HHe seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, "So! You are
a physiognomist.. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
so  muchh  pleasure coming to you to breakfast, and, oh, sir,

you  will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed
in your wiife."
     I wouldd listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so
I siimply nodded and stood silent.
      "She is one of God's women,fashioned by His own hand to
show us men andd other women that  there is a heaven where we
can entter, and that its light can be here on earth. So true,
so sweet, so  noble, so little an egoist,  and that,  let me
tell you,, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish. And
yyou, sir. . . I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
and some off them speak of you, so I know you since some days
froom the knowing of others, but  I  have seen your true self
since last niight.  You will give me your hand, will you not?
And llet us be friends for all our lives."
     We shook haands, and he was so  earnest and so kind that
it made  me quite choky.
      "and now," he said,  "may I ask you for some more help?
I have  a   great  task to do,  and at the beginning it is to
knoow.  You can help me here.  Can  you tell me what went be-
fore your goiing to Transylvania?  Later  on  I may ask  more
help,, and of a different kind, but at first this will do."
     "Look  here,  Sir,"  I said,  "does what you have to do
concern tthe Count?"
     ""It does," he said solemnly."
     ""Then  I  am with you heart and soul.  As you go by the
10:30 train,  yoou  will  not  have  time to read them, but I
shall geet the bundle of papers.  You can take them with  you

and read them in the train."
     AAfter breakfast I saw him to the station.  When we were
parting  he  saiid,  "Perhaps you will come to town if I send
for you,, and take Madam Mina too."
     "Wee shall both come when you will," I said.
     I had ggot him  the morning papers and the London papers
of tthe  previous  night,  and  while  we were talking at the
carriage windoow, waiting for the train to start, he was turn-
ing tthem over.  His eyes suddenly seemed to catch  something
in one of them,, "The Westminster Gazette", I knew it  by the
color,  and he grew quite white.  He read something intently,
groaning to himself, "Mein Gott!  Mein Gott!  So  soon!   So
soon!"  II do not think he remembered me at the moment.  Just
tthen the whistle blew, and the train moved off.This recalled
him to himsself, and he leaned out of the  window  and  waved
hiss hand, calling out, "Love to Madam Mina. I shall write so
soon as ever  I can."

 DR. SESEWARD'S DIARY

       26 September.--Truly there is no such thing as finality.
Not a week  since I said  "Finis," and yet here I am starting
freesh again, or rather going on with the record.  Until this
afternoon I hhad no cause to think of what is done.  Renfield
had bbecome, to all intents, as  sane as he ever was.  He was
already well  aahead  with his  fly business, and he had just
startedd in the spider  line  also, so he had not been of any
trouble to me.  I had a letter  from Arthur, written on Sun-
day, and  from it I gather that he  is bearing up wonderfully
wwell.  Quincey  Morris  is  with  him, and that is much of a
help,  for   he  himself is a  bubbling well of good spirits.
Quiincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur
is beginning  to recover something of his old buoyancy, so as
to thhem all my mind is at rest.  As for myself, I was  sett-
ling down to myy work  with  the enthusiasm  which I used  to
have foor it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound
which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised.

     Everything is, however, now reopened, and what is to be
the end  GGod  only  knows.  I have  an idea that Van Helsing
thhinks  he  knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a
time to whett curiosity.  He  went  to  Exeter yesterday, and
stayyed  there all  night.  Today he  came back,  and  almost
bounded into tthe room  at about  half-past five o'clock, and
thrustt last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.
      "What do you think of that?"  he asked as he stood back
and folded hiis arms.
     I loooked over the paper, for I really did not know what
hhe meant, but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph
about childdren being  decoyed away at Hampstead.  It did not
connvey much  to  me, until I reached a passage where it des-
cribed small  puncture wounds on their throats.An idea struck
me, aand I looked up.
      "Well?" he said.
     "It is liike poor Lucy's."

     "And what do you make of it?"

     "Simply  that  there is some cause in common.  Whatever
it was thaat injured her  has injured them."  I did not quite
unnderstand his answer.
     "That is  true indirectly, but not directly."
     "How do you mean, Professor?"  I asked.  I was a little
inclined  to take  his  seriousness lightly, for,  after all,
ffour days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing,  anx-
iety does hhelp to restore one's spirits, but when  I saw his
facce, it sobered me.  Never, even in  the midst  of our des-
pair about pooor Lucy, had he looked more stern.

     "Tell me!" I said.  "I can hazard no opinion.  I do not
know what  to think, and I have  no  data on which to found a
coonjecture."
     ""Do you mean to tell me,  friend John, that you have no
suspicion  as  tto what  poor Lucy died of, not after all the
hints giiven, not only by events, but by me?"
     "Of nervouss prostration following a great loss or waste
of bloodd."
     "And how  was the blood lost or wasted?" I shook my head.
      He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on,"You
are a clever mman, friend John.  You reason well, and your wit
is boold, but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes
see nor your eears hear, and that which is outside  your daily
life  is not of account to you.  Do  you not think that  there
are things whiich you cannot understand,and yet which are,that
some  people see things  that others  cannot?  But  there  are
things  old  aand  new which must not be contemplated by men's
eyes,, because they know, or think they know,some things which
other men havee told them.  Ah, it is the fault of our science
that  it wants to explain all, and  if it explain not, then it
says there is  nothing to explain.  But  yet  we see around us
everyy day the growth of new beliefs,  which think  themselves
new, and whichh are yet but the old, which pretend to be young,
likee the fine ladies at the opera.  I  suppose now you do not
believe in coorporeal transference. No? Nor in materialization.
No?? Nor in astral bodies. No?  Nor in the  reading of thought.
No? Nor in  hypnotism . . ."

     "Yes," I said.  "Charcot has proved that pretty well."
     He  smmiled  as he went on, "Then you are satisfied as to
itt.  Yes?  And of  course then you understand how it act, and
can follow  the mind of  the great Charcot, alas that he is no
moore, into the very soul of the patient that he influence.No?
Then, friennd John,am I to take it that you simply accept fact,
aand are  satisfied  to  let  from  premise to conclusion be a
blank?  Noo?  Then tell me, for I am a student  of  the brain,
hhow you accept hypnotism and reject the thought reading.  Let
me tell yoou, my friend, that there  are things done  today in
eelectrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the
very man wwho discovered electricity, who would themselves not
sso long before been burned as wizards.  There are always mys-
teries in  life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred
yyears, and `Old Parr'one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that
poor Lucy,, with four men's blood in her poor veins, could not
llive  even one day?  For, had she live one more day, we could
save her.   Do you know all the mystery of life and death?  Do
yyou know the  altogether  of  comparative anatomy and can say
wherefore  the qualities of brutes  are  in  some men, and not
iin others?  Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small
and  soon,, that  one great spider lived  for centuries in the
ttower of the old Spanish church and  grew and grew,  till, on
descendingg, he could drink  the oil of  all the church lamps?
CCan you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere,there are
bats that  come out at night and open the veins  of cattle and
hhorses and suck dry their veins, how in some  islands  of the
Western seeas there are bats which hang on  the trees all day,
aand those who have seen describe as  like giant nuts or pods,
and that wwhen the sailors  sleep on the deck, because that it
iis hot, flit down on them and  then,  and then in the morning
are found  dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?"
     "Good  GGod,  Professor!"  I said,  starting up.  "Do you
meann to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat, and  that
such a thing  is here in London in the nineteenth century?"
     Hee waved his hand for silence, and went on,"Can you tell
me why the tortooise lives more long than generations  of men,
why thee elephant goes on and on till he have sees  dynasties,
and why the parrrot never die only of bite  of cat of  dog  or
other ccomplaint?  Can you tell me why men believe in all ages
and places that  there are men and women who cannot  die?   We
all knoow, because science has vouched for the fact,that there
have been toads  shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut
in one  so small hole that only hold him since  the  youth  of
the world. Can yyou tell me how the Indian fakir can make him-
self too die and have been buried, and  his  grave  sealed and
corn sowed on itt, and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and
reaped  and cut again, and then men come and take away the un-
broken seal  andd  that there lie the Indian  fakir, not dead,
but thaat rise up and walk amongst them as before?"
     Heree I interrupted him.  I  was  getting bewildered.  He

so crowded on my mind his list of nature's eccentricities and
possible   impossibilities  that  my  imagination  was getting

fired.  I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson,
as long aago  he used to do in his study at Amsterdam.  But he

used them to tell  me the thing, so that I could have the ob-
ject of   thought in mind all the time.  But now I was without

his help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said,
      "Professor,  let  me be your pet student again.  Tell me
the thesis, sso that  I may apply your knowledge as you go on.
At ppresent I  am  going  in my  mind from point to point as a
madman, and nnot a sane one, follows  an  idea.  I feel like a
noviice lumbering through  a  bog in a midst, jumping from one
tussock to annother in the mere  blind effort to move on with-
out  knowing where I am going."
     "Thhat is  a  good image,"  he said.  "Well, I shall tell
you.  My thesis is this, I want you to believe."
      "To believe what?"
     "To belieeve in things that you cannot.Let me illustrate.
I heaard once of an American who so defined faith,  `that fac-
ulty which enaables us to believe things  which  we know to be
untruue.'  For one, I follow that man.  He meant that we shall
have an open mmind,and not let a little bit of truth check the
rush  of the big truth,like a small rock does a railway truck.
We  get  the   small truth  first.  Good!  We keep him, and we
valuee him, but all the same we must not let him think himself
all the truth  in the universe."
     "Then  you  want me not  to let some previous conviction
inure thhe receptivity of my mind with  regard to some strange
matter.  Do I read your lesson aright?"
     "Ah, yoou are  my  favorite  pupil still.  It is worth to
teaach you.  Now that you are willing  to understand, you have
taken the fiirst  step  to  understand.  You  think  then that
thoose so small holes in  the children's throats  were made by
the same thaat made the holes in Miss Lucy?"
      "I suppose so."
     He stood up and said solemnly,  "Then you are wrong. Oh,
would itt were so! But alas! No. It is worse, far, far worse."
     "In God's name,Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?"
I cried..
     He threw hiimself with a despairing gesture into a chair,
and plaaced  his  elbows  on the table, covering his face with
his hands as he  spoke.
     "Theyy were made by Miss Lucy!"


CHAPTAPTER 15

                   DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-cont.


     For a while  sheer  anger mastered me.  It was as if he
had  durinng  her life  struck Lucy on the face.  I smote the
taable  hard and rose up as  I said to him, "Dr. Van Helsing,
are you mad??"
     He  raisedd  his  head and looked at me, and somehow the
tendernness of his face calmed me at once. "Would I were!" he
said.  "Madness  were easy to  bear compared with truth like
this. Oh,, my friend, whey, think you, did I go so far round,
wwhy take so long to tell so simple a thing? Was it because I
hate you annd have hated you all my life?  Was  it  because I
wisshed to give you pain?  Was it that  I wanted, no so late,
revenge for   that  time when  you  saved my life, and from a
fearfful death?  Ah no!"
     "Forgive mee," said I.
     HHe  went on, "My  friend, it was because I wished to be
gentle in  the   breaking to  you, for I know  you have loved
that so  sweet lady.  But even  yet  I do  not expect  you to

believe.  It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth,
that  we  may doubt such to be possible when  we have  always
bbelieved the `no' of it.  It is more hard still to accept so
sad a concrrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy.Tonight
I ggo to prove it.  Dare you come with me?"
     This staaggered me.  A man does not like to prove such a
truthh, Byron excepted from the catagory, jealousy.

          "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."

       He saw my hesitation, and spoke,  "The logic is simple,
no madman's llogic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock
in a  misty bog. If it not be true, then proof will be relief.
At worst it wiill not harm.  If it be true!  Ah, there is the
dread..  Yet every dread  should  help my cause, for in it is
some need of bellief. Come, I tell you what I propose. First,
that we  go off now and see  that child in the hospital.  Dr.

Vincent, of  the  North  Hospital, where  the papers say the
child  is,, is  a friend of  mine, and I think of yours since
yoou were in class at Amsterdam.  He  will let two scientists
see his casee, if he will not let two friends.  We shall tell
him  nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then . . ."
     "And thenn?"
     He took aa key from his pocket and held it up. "And then
we speend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where  Lucy
lies.  This is tthe key that lock the tomb. I had it from the
coffin mman to give to Arthur."
     My hearrt sank within me, for I felt that there was some
fearrful ordeal before us.  I could do nothing, however, so I
plucked up whaat  heart  I  could and said that we had better
hastenn, as the afternoon was passing.
      We found the child awake.  It had had a sleep and taken
some food, annd  altogether was  going on  well.  Dr, Vincent
took  the bandage from its  throat, and  showed us the punct-
ures.  There waas no mistaking  the similarity to those which
had beeen on Lucy's throat.  They were smaller, and the edges
looked fresher, that was all.  We  asked  Vincent to what he
attributeed  them,  and  he  replied that it must have been a
bbite of some animal, perhaps a rat, but for his own part, he
was  inclinned  to think it was one of the bats which are  so
nummerous on the northern heights of London.  "Out of so many
harmless oness,"  he said, "there  may be some wild  specimen
from  the South of a more malignant species.  Some sailor may
have brought onne home, and it managed to escape,or even from
the Zooological Gardens a young one may have got loose,or one
be bred there  from a vampire.  These  things do occur, you,
know.  Onnly ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe,
ttraced up in this direction.  For a week after, the children
were playinng nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in
eveery  alley in  the  place  until this `bloofer lady' scare
came along, ssince then it  has been quite a  gala  time with
them..  Even  this  poor  little mite, when he woke up today,
asked the nursee if he might go away.  When she asked him why
he wantted to go, he said he wanted to play with the `bloofer
lady'."
     "I  hope,"  said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending

the child home you  will  caution its parents to keep strict
watch overr it.  These  fancies  to stray are most dangerous,
annd if the child were to remain out  another night, it would
probably be  fatal.  But in  any case I  suppose you will not
let  it away for some days?"
     "Certaainly not, not for  a week at least, longer if the
wouund is not healed."
     Our visit   to  the hospital  took more time than we had
reckonedd on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When

Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said,
     "Theree is  not  hurry.  It is more late than I thought.
Comme, let  us seek somewhere that  we  may eat, and then  we
shall go on oour way."
     We  dined at  `Jack Straw's Castle'  along with a little

crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy.About
ten o'clocck we started from the inn.  It was then very dark,
annd the scattered lamps  made the darkness  greater when  we
were once ouutside their individual radius. The Professor had
eviddently  noted the  road we were to go, for he went on un-
hesitatingly,  but, as for me, I was in quite  a  mixup as to
localiity.  As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people,
till at last wee were somewhat surprised when we met even the
patrol  of horse police going their usual suburban round.  At
last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed
over. Witth some little difficulty, for it was very dark, and
tthe whole place seemed  so strange to us, we found the West-
enra tomb.   The Professor  took  the  key, opened the creaky
dooor, and standing back, politely,  but quite unconsciously,
motioned me tto precede him.  There was a  delicious irony in
the ooffer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a
ghastly occasioon.  My  companion  followed  me  quickly, and
cautiouusly drew  the  door  to, after carefully ascertaining
that the lock was  a  falling, and not a spring one.  In the
latter  ccase  we should  have been in a bad plight.  Then he
ffumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of
candle, prooceeded to make a light.  The tomb in the daytime,
andd when wreathed with fresh flowers, had  looked  grim  and
gruesome enouugh,  but now, some  days afterwards,  when  the
floweers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and
their greens too browns, when the spider and  the beetle  had
resumedd their accustomed dominance, when the time-discolored
stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and  rusty, dank iron, and
tarnishedd brass, and  clouded  silver-plating gave back  the
ffeeble glimmer of a candle, the  effect  was more  miserable
and sordid   than could have been imagined.  It conveyed irr-
esiistibly the idea that life,  animal life, was not the only
thing which ccould pass away.
      Van Helsing went about  his work systematically.  Hold-
ing his canndle so that he could read the  coffin plates, and
so  holding it that the sperm dropped in white  patches which
congealed  ass they touched  the  metal, he made assurance of
Lucy''s coffin.  Another search in his bag, and he took out a
turnscrew.
       "What are you going to do?" I asked.
     "To open  the coffin.  You shall yet be convinced."
     Straigghtway he began taking out the screws, and finally
liffted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath.  The
sight was almmost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an
affroont to  the dead  as it would have been to have stripped
off her clothinng in her sleep whilst living. I actually took
hold off his hand to stop him.
     He onlyy said, "You shall see,"and again fumbling in his
bag  took out a tiny fret saw. Striking the turnscrew through
the lead with  a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
made aa small hole, which was,  however, big  enough to admit
the point of thee saw.  I had expected a rush of gas from the
week-oldd corpse.  We doctors, who have had to study our dan-

gers, have  to become accustomed to  such things, and I drew
back towarrds  the door.  But the Professor never stopped for
a  moment.  He sawed  down a couple of feet along one side of
the lead cofffin, and then  across, and down  the other side.
Takiing the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards
the foot of thhe coffin, and holding up the  candle into  the
apertuure, motioned to me to look.
     I  drew near and looked.  The coffin was empty.  It  was
certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock,
but Van  Helsing was unmoved.  He was now more sure than ever

of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task."Are
you satisffied now, friend John?"  he asked.
      I felt  all  the  dogged argumentativeness of my nature
awake withiin me as  I answered  him,  "I  am  satisfied that
Luccy's  body is not in that coffin, but that only proves one
thing."
       "And what is that, friend John?"
      "That it is not there."
     "TThat is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes.  But
how do you, how can you, account for it not being there?"
     "Perhapps  a  body-snatcher," I suggested.  "Some of the
undeertaker's people  may have stolen it."  I felt that I was
speaking follyy, and yet it  was  the only real cause which I
could  suggest.
     Thee Professor sighed. "Ah well!" he said," we must have

more proof.  Come with me."
     Hee  put  on the  coffin lid  again, gathered up all his
things and placed them in the bag, blew  out  the light, and
placed  tthe candle also in the bag.  We opened the door, and
wwent  out.  Behind us  he closed the door and locked it.  He
handed me tthe key, saying, "Will you keep it? You had better
be  assured."
     I  laughed, it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound
to say, as I motioned him to keep it.  "A key is nothing," I
said, "thhee are many duplicates, and anyhow it is not diffi-
ccult to pick a lock of this kind."
      He said  nothing, but put the  key in his pocket.  Then
he told me  to watch at one side of the  churchyard whilst he
wouuld watch at the other.
      I  toook  up my  place behind a yew tree, and I saw his
darkk figure move until the intervening  headstones and trees
hid it from myy sight.
    It waas a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I
hheard a distant clock strike twelve,and in time came one and
two.I was cchilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor
forr  taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming.
I was too colld and too sleepy to be keenly observant,and not
sleeppy enough  to  betray  my trust,  so  altogether I had a
dreary, miserabble time.
     Sudddenly,  as I turned round, I thought I saw something

like a white streak,moving between two dark yew trees at the
side of thhe churchyard farthest from the tomb.  At the  same
tiime  a dark  mass  moved  from the  Professor's side of the
ground, and  hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved, but
I  hhad to  go  round headstones  and railed-off tombs, and I
stumbled over  graves.The sky was overcast, and somewhere far
off ann early cock  crew. A little ways off, beyond a line of
scattered  junipper trees,  which marked  the  pathway to the
church,  a white  dim  figure flitted in the direction of the

tomb.  The tomb itself was  hidden by trees, and I could not
see where  the figure had disappeared.  I heard the rustle of
acctual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
coming over,,  found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny
chilld.  When he saw me he held it out to me, and said,  "Are
you satisfied  now?"
     "No,"  I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.
     "Doo you not see the child?"
     "Yes,, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it
woounded?"
     "We  shall see,"said the Professor, and with one impulse
wwe took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleep-
ing child..
     When we hadd got some little distance away, we went into
a clump   of  trees, and  struck a  match, and  looked at the

child's throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.
     "Wass I right?"  I asked triumphantly.
      "We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully.
     We had  now to decide what we were to do with the child,
and  so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police
station we shoould have to give some account of our movements
duringg the night.  At least, we should have had to make some
statement as to  how we had come to find the child.So finally
we decidded that we would take it to the Heath,  and  when we

heard a policeman coming, would leave it  where he could not
fail to fiind it.  We would then seek our way home as quickly
ass we could.  All fell  out well.  At the edge  of Hampstead
Heath we  heeard  a  policeman's heavy tramp,  and laying the
chilld on the pathway, we waited and watched until he  saw it
as he flashed  his lantern to and fro.  We heard  his exclam-
ation  of  astonishment,  and then we went away silently.  By
good chance we ggot a cab near the `Spainiards,' and drove to
town.
 
     I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to
get a few hhours' sleep, as Van Helsing is to  call for me at
nooon.  He insists that I go with him on another expedition.

     27 Septptember.--It  was  two  o'clock  before we found a
suittable opportunity for our attempt.  The funeral  held  at
noon was all ccompleted, and the last stragglers of the mour-
ners hhad taken  themselves  lazily away, when, looking care-
fully from behinnd a clump of alder trees, we saw the  sexton
lock  thhe  gate  after  him.  We knew that we were safe till

morning did we desire it, but the Professor told me  that we
should nott want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that
hoorrid sense of the reality of things,in which any effort of
imagination  seemed out of place, and  I realized  distinctly
the   perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhal-
lowed work.  BBesides, I felt it was all so useless.  Outrag-
eous aas it was to open a leaden coffin,  to  see  if a woman
dead nearly a weeek were really dead,it now seemed the height
of follyy to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evi-

dence of our own eyesight,  that the  coffin  was  empty.  I
shrugged mmy shoulders,  however, and rested silent, for  Van
Heelsing had a  way  of going  on his own road, no matter who
remonstratedd.  He took the key, opened  the vault, and again
courrteously motioned me to  precede.  The  place  was not so
gruesome as laast night, but oh, how unutterably mean looking
when tthe sunshine streamed in.  Van Helsing  walked over  to
Lucy's coffin, aand I followed. He bent over and again forced
back thee leaden flange, and  a shock  of surprise and dismay

shot through me.

     There  lay Lucy, seemingly  just as we had seen her the
night befoore her funeral.  She  was, if possible, more radi-
anntly beautiful than ever, and I could not  believe that she
was dead.  TThe lips  were red, nay  redder than  before, and
on tthe cheeks was a delicate bloom.
      "Is this a juggle?" I said to him.
     "Are you coonvinced now?" said the Professor,in response,
and as  he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made
me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed  the  white
teeth. "SSee," he went on,"they are even sharper than before.
WWith this  and this," and he touched one of the canine teeth
and that beelow it,  "the little children can be bitten.  Are
youu of belief now, friend John?"
      Once more  argumentative  hostility  woke within me.  I
could not acceppt such an overwhelming idea as  he suggested.
So, witth an attempt to argue of which I was even at the mom-
ent ashamed, I said, "She may have  been placed  here  since
last nighht."
     "Indeed??  That is so, and by whom?"
     "II do not know.  Someone has done it."
     "And yet  sshe  has  been dead one week. Most peoples in
that timme would not look so."
     I had noo answer  for  this, so was silent.  Van Helsing
did nnot seem to notice my silence.  At  any  rate, he showed
neither chagrinn nor triumph.  He was looking intently at the
face off the dead woman,  raising the eyelids and  looking at
the eyes, and  once  more opening the lips and examining the
teeth.  TThen he turned to me and said,
      "Here,  there is  one thing which is different from all
recorded.  Heree is some dual life that is not as the common.
She  waas  bitten  by  the  vampire when she was in a trance,
sleep-walking, oh, you start.  You do not know that,  friend
John, butt you shall know it later, and  in trance  could  he
bbest come to take more blood.  In  trance she  dies,  and in
trance she  is Un-Dead, too.  So it  is that she  differ from
alll other.  Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home,"  as  he
spoke he madee a comprehensive sweep of his arm to  designate
what  to a vampire was `home', "their face show what they are,
but this so swweet that was when she not Un-Dead  she go back
to thee nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there,
see, and so it  make hard that I must kill her in her sleep."
     Thhis turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me
that I was accepting Van Helsing's theories. But if she were
really deead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing
hher?
     He  lookked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my
face,, for he said almost joyously, "Ah, you believe now?"

     I answered, "Do not press me too hard all at once. I am
willing too accept.  How will you do this bloody work?"
     "I   shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with gar-

lic, and I shall drive a stake through her body."
      It  made  me shudder to think of so mutilating the body
of the woman  whom I  had loved.  And yet the feeling was not
so sttrong  as I  had expected.  I was, in fact, beginning to
shudder at the  presence  of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van
Helsingg called it,  and to loathe  it.  Is  it possible that
love is all subjective, or all objective?
     I waiited a considerable time for Van  Helsing to begin,
buut he stood as if wrapped in thought.  Presently  he closed
the catch off his bag with a snap, and said,
      "I have been thinking,  and  have made up my mind as to
what is best..  If I did simply  follow my inclining  I would
do noow, at this moment, what is to  be done.  But  there are
other things  tto  follow, and things that are thousand times
more diifficult in that them we do not know.  This is simple.
She have yet no life  taken, though  that is of time, and to
act now wwould be to take danger from her  forever.  But then
wwe may have  to  want  Arthur, and  how shall we tell him of
this?  If yyou, who saw the wounds on Lucy's throat, and  saw
thee wounds so similar on the child's at the hospital, if you,
who saw  thee  coffin empty last night and full today  with a
womaan who have not change only to be more rose and more beau-
tiful in a whhole week, after she die,if you know of this and
know  of the white figure last night that  brought  the child
to  the churchyyard,  and yet of  your own senses you did not
believee,  how  then, can I  expect  Arthur, who know none of
those things, to believe?
     "Hee doubted me when  I  took him from her kiss when she

was dying.  I  know  he has forgiven me because in some mis-
taken ideaa I have done  things  that prevent him say goodbye
ass  he  ought, and  he may  think that in some more mistaken
idea this wooman was buried alive, and that  in  most mistake
of aall we have killed her.  He will  then argue back that it
is we, mistakeen ones, that have killed her by our ideas, and
so he  will be much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure,
and that is the  worst of all.  And he will  sometimes  think
that shee he loved was buried alive, and that will  paint his

dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered,and again,
he will tthink that we may be right, and that his  so beloved
wwas, after all, an Un-Dead.  No!  I told him once, and since
then I learrn much.  Now, since I know it is all true, a hun-
dreed thousand times more do I know that he must pass through
the bitter waaters to reach the sweet.  He, poor fellow, must
have  one hour that will make the  very face  of  heaven grow
black to him,thhen we can act for good all round and send him
peace.   My mind is made up.  Let us go.  You return home for
tonight to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me,
I shall sspend the night here in  this  churchyard in my  own
wway.  Tomorrow  night  you  will come to  me to the Berkeley
Hotel at teen of the clock.  I  shall send for Arthur to come
tooo,and also that so fine young man of America that gave his
blood.  Laterr we shall all have work to do.  I come with you
so faar as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here
before the sun  set."
     So we  locked  the tomb  and came away, and got over the
walll of the churchyard, which  was  not  much of a task, and
drove back too Piccadilly.

        27 Sepeptember

"Friend d John,
     "I wriite this in case anything should happen.I go alone
to  watch in that churchyard.  It pleases me that the Un-Dead,
Miss Lucy, sshall not leave tonight,  that so on  the  morrow
nighht  she may  be  more  eager.  Therefore I shall fix some
things she likke not,  garlic  and a crucifix, and so seal up
the dooor of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed.
Moreover, thesee are only to prevent her coming out. They may
not preevail  on her wanting to  get in, for then the Un-Dead
is  desperate,  and must  find the line of least resistance,
whatsoeveer it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from
suunset till after sunrise,and if there be aught that may be
learned I shaall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have
no feaar,but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead,
he have not the  power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He
is cunninng, as  I  know from  Mr. Jonathan and from the way
thhat all along he have fooled us when he played with us for
Miss Lucy's llife, and we lost, and in many ways the Un-Dead
are sttrong.  He  have  always  the strength  in his hand of
twenty men, even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy
it also iss all to him.  Besides, he can summon his wolf and
I kknow not what.  So  if it be that he came thither on this
night he shalll find me.  But none  other shall, until it be
too latte. But it may be that he will not attempt the place.

There is no  reason why he  should.  His hunting ground  is
more full oof game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead wo-
man  sleeps, and the one old man watch.

     "Therefore  I write this in case . . . Take the papers
that are wiith this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and
readd them,  and  then  find this great Un-Dead, and cut off
his head and buurn his heart or drive a stake through it, so
that thee world may rest from him.
     "If  it be so, farewell.
     "VAN HELSIING."

  DR. SEWAWARD'S DIARY

       28 September.--It is  wonderful  what  a  good  night's
sleep will do  for one.  Yesterday I was  almost  willing  to
acceptt  Van Helsing's monstrous ideas, but now they  seem to
start out lurid  before me as outrages on common sense.I have
no doubtt that he believes it all.  I wonder if his  mind can

have become in any way unhinged.  Surely there  must be some
rational eexplanation of all these mysterious  things.  Is it
poossible that the Professor can have done it himself?  He is
so abnormallly clever that if he went off  his head  he would
carrry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a won-
derful way.   I am loathe to think it, and indeed it would be
almosst as great a marvel as the other to find  that Van Hel-
sing was mad, bbut anyhow I shall watch him carefully.  I may
get somme light on the mystery.

     29 S September.--Last  night,  at  a  little  before  ten
oo'clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room. He
told us alll what he wanted us to do, but especially address-
ingg himself to  Arthur, as if all our wills were centered in
his. He begann by saying that he hoped we would all come with
him ttoo, "for,"  he said,  "there is a grave duty to be done
there.  You werre doubtless surprised at  my  letter?"   This
query wwas directly addressed to Lord Godalming.
   "I was.   It rather upset me for a bit.  There has been so
muchh trouble around my house of late that I could do without
any more.  I hhave been curious, too, as to what you mean.
     "Quiincey and  I talked it over, but the more we talked,
tthe more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself  that
I'm about uup a tree as to any meaning about anything."
     "Me  too," said Quincey Morris laconically.
     "Oh,"  saaid the Professor, "then you are nearer the be-
ginninng, both  of  you, than friend John here, who has to go
a long way back  before he can even get so far as to begin."
     It wwas evident  that he  recognized my return to my old
ddoubting frame of mind without my saying a word. Then, turn-
ing to the  other two, he said with intense gravity,
     "I wantt your permission to  do what I  think  good this
nighht.  It is, I know, much to ask, and when  you know  what
it is I proposse to do you will know, and only then how much.
Thereffore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that
afterwards, thouugh you may be angry with  me  for  a time, I
must nott disguise from myself the  possibility that such may

be, you shall not blame yourselves for anything."
      "That's frank anyhow,"  broke in Quincey.  "I'll answer
for the Profeessor.  I don't quite see his drift, but I swear
he's  honest, and that's good enough for me."
     "I thankk you, Sir," said Van Helsing proudly.  "I have
done mmyself  the honor of counting you one trusting friend,
and such endorsement is dear to me."  He held out  a  hand,
which Quinncey took.
     Thhen Arthur spoke out, "Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite

like to `buy a pig in a poke', as they say in Scotland, and
if it be annything in which my honour  as  a gentleman or my
faitth as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a pro-
mise.  If you   can  assure me that what you intend does not
violatee either of these two, then I give my consent at once,
though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are
driving att."
     "I acceptt your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all
I ask oof you  is  that  if you feel it necessary to condemn

any  act  of mine, you  will  first consider it well and be
satisfied tthat it does not violate your reservations."
     "Agrreed!"  said Arthur.  "That is only fair.  And  now
thhat the pourparlers are over, may I ask  what it is we are
to do?"
       "I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to
the churchyard  at Kingstead."
      Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way,
     "Where  poor Lucy is buried?"
     The Proffessor bowed.
      Arthur went on, "And when there?"

     "To enter the tomb!"
     Arthhur stood up.  "Professor, are you in earnest, or is
iit some  monstrous  joke?  Pardon me,  I see that you are in
earnest."   He  sat down  again,  but I could see that he sat
firrmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity.  There was
silence untill he asked again, "And when in the tomb?"
     "To opeen the coffin."
      "This is too much!"  he said, angrily rising again.  "I
am willing tto be patient in  all things that are reasonable,
but  in this,this desecration of the grave, of one who . . ."
He fairly chokked with indignation.
     The Profeessor looked pityingly at him."If I could spare
you onne pang, my poor friend," he said, "God  knows I would.
But this night oour feet must tread in thorny paths,or later,
and for   ever,  the  feet  you  love  must  walk in paths of

flame!"
     Arthhur  looked  up  with set white face and said, "Take
ccare, sir, take care!"
     "Would iit not be well to hear what I have to say?" said
Van HHelsing.  "And then  you will at least know the limit of
my purpose.  Shhall I go on?"
      "That's fair enough," broke in Morris.
     After   a  pause  Van Helsing went on, evidently with an
effoort, "Miss Lucy  is dead, is it not so?  Yes!  Then there
can be no wronng to her.  But if she be not dead. . ."
     Arthur jjumped to his feet, "Good God!"  he cried. "What
do yoou mean? Has there been any mistake, has she been buried
alive?"He groanned in anguish that not even hope could soften.
     ""I did not say she was alive, my child. I did not think
it.  I go no furrther than to say that she might be Un-Dead."
     "Unn-Dead!  Not alive!  What do you mean?  Is this all a

nightmare, or what is it?"
     "Thhere are mysteries which men can only guess at, which

age by age they may  solve only in part.  Believe me, we are
now on thee verge of one. But I have not done.  May I cut off
thhe head of dead Miss Lucy?"
     "Heeavens and earth, no!"   cried  Arthur  in a storm of

passion.  "Not for the wide world  will  I  consent  to  any
mutilationn of her  dead body.  Dr. Van  Helsing,  you try me
tooo far.  What  have  I  done to you that you should torture
me so?  Whatt did  that  poor,  sweet girl do that you should
wantt to cast such dishonor on her  grave?  Are you mad, that
you speak of ssuch things, or am  I mad  to listen  to  them?
Don't   dare think more  of  such a desecration.  I shall not
give my consent  to anything you do.  I have a duty to  do in
protectiing her grave from outrage,and by God, I shall do it!"
     Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been
seated, aand said, gravely and sternly, "My Lord Godalming, I
ttoo, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty  to  you, a
duty to thee dead, and by God, I shall do it!  All I  ask you
noww is that you come with me, that you look and  listen, and
if when  lateer I make the same request you do  not  be  more
eagerr for its fulfillment even than I am, then,I shall do my
duty, whatever  it may seem to me.  And  then, to follow your
Lordshiip's wishes I shall hold myself  at  your  disposal to
render an account to you,when and where you will." His voice
broke a llittle, and he went on with a voice full of pity.
      "But I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me.In
a long life off acts which were often not pleasant to do, and
which  sometimes did wring my heart,I have never had so heavy
a task as now.   Believe me that if the time comes for you to
change yyour mind towards me,one look from you will wipe away

all this so sad hour, for I would do what a  man can to save
you from ssorrow.  Just think.  For  why should I give myself
soo much labor and so much of sorrow?  I have  come here from
my own land  to do what I can of good, at the first to please
my ffriend John,and then to help a sweet young lady, whom too,
I come to lovve.  For her, I am ashamed to say so much, but I
say   it  in kindness,  I gave what you gave, the blood of my
veins.  I gave  it, I who was  not, like you, her lover,  but
only heer physician and her friend.  I gave her my nights and
days, before death, after death, and if my death  can do her
good evenn now, when she is the dead Un-Dead,  she shall have
iit freely." He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and
Arthur was  much affected by it.
     He took tthe old man's  hand and said in a broken voice,
"Oh, iit is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand, but
at least I shalll go with you and wait."


CHAPTERTER 16

                    DR SEWARD'S DIARY-cont.

       It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got
into the  chhurchyard  over the low wall.  The night was dark
withh occasional gleams of moonlight between the dents of the
heavy clouds tthat scudded across the sky.  We all kept some-
how cllose together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he
led the way.Whenn we had come close to the tomb I looked well
at Arthuur, for I feared the proximity to a  place laden with

so sorrowful a memory would upset him,  but he  bore himself
well.  I ttook it that the very mystery of the proceeding was
inn some way a counteractant to his  grief. The Professor un-
locked the ddoor, and seeing a natural  hesitation amongst us
for  various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first
himself. The rrest of us followed, and he closed the door. He
then llit a dark lantern and pointed to a coffin.Arthur step-
ped forward hesiitatingly.  Van Helsing said to me, "You were
with me  here  yesterday.  Was the  body of Miss Lucy in that

coffin?"
     "Itt was."
     The PProfessor turned to the rest saying, "You hear, and
yeet there is no one who does not believe with me.'
      He  took his screwdriver and  again took off the lid of
the coffin.  AArthur  looked on, very  pale but silent.  When
the liid was removed he stepped forward. He evidently did not
know that there  was a leaden coffin, or at any rate, had not
thought  of it.   When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood

rushed to his face for an instant, but  as quickly fell away
again, so  that he remained  of  a ghastly whiteness.  He was
sttill silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and
we all lookeed in and recoiled.
     The coffin  was empty!
     FFor  several  minutes no one spoke a word.  The silence
was broken by Quuincey Morris, "Professor, I answered for you.
Your woord is all I want.  I wouldn't ask such a thing ordin-
arily, I wouldn't so dishonor you  as to imply a doubt,  but
this is aa mystery that goes beyond any honor or dishonor. Is
tthis your doing?"

     "I  swear to  you by all that I hold sacred that I have
not removeed  or touched  her.  What happened  was this.  Two
niights ago my friend Seward and I came  here, with good pur-
pose, believve me.I opened that coffin, which was then sealed
up,  and we found it as now, empty.  We then waited, and  saw
something whitte come through the trees. The next day we came
here iin daytime and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?
     "Yes."
       "That  night we  were just  in time.  One more so small
child was misssing, and we find it,thank God,unharmed amongst
the ggraves.Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sun-
down the Un-Deaad can move.  I waited here all night till the
sun rosse, but I saw nothing.  It  was most  probable that it
was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
which thhe Un-Dead cannot bear, and  other things  which they

shun.  Last night there was no exodus, so tonight before the
sundown I  took away my garlic and other things. And so it is
wee find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is
much that iss strange.  Wait you with  me outside, unseen and
unheeard, and things much stranger are yet to be.So," here he
shut the dark  slide of his lantern,"now to the outside."  He
openedd the door,and we filed out, he coming last and locking
the door behind  him.
     Oh! Butt it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after
the  terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds
race by, and tthe passing gleams of the moonlight between the
scuddiing clouds crossing and passing, like  the gladness and
sorrow of a man''s life.How sweet it was to breathe the fresh
air, thaat had no taint of death and decay. How humanizing to

see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear
far away tthe muffled roar  that marks  the  life of  a great
ciity.  Each in his own  way was solemn and overcome.  Arthur
was silent,  and was, I could see, striving to grasp the pur-
posee and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tol-
erably patientt, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt
and too accept Van Helsing's conclusions.  Quincey Morris was
phlegmatic  in   the way of a man who accepts all things, and
accepts  them in the spirit of cool  bravery, with  hazard of

all he has at stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself
a good-sizzed plug of tobacco and  began to  chew.  As to Van
Heelsing, he  was employed  in a definite way.  First he took
from his bagg a mass  of  what looked  like  thin, wafer-like
bisccuit, which  was carefully  rolled up  in a white napkin.
Next he took oout a double handful of some whitish stuff,like
dough  or putty.  He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it
into the mass beetween his hands. This he then took, and roll-
ing it  into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices
between  the  door and its setting in the tomb.  I was some-
what puzzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was
tthat he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also,as they
too were cuurious.
     He annswered, "I am closing the tomb so that the Un-Dead
maay not enter."
      "And is that stuff you have there going to do it?"

     "It Is."
      "What is that which you are using?" This time the ques-
tion was  by   Arthur.  Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat
as hee answered.
     ""The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam.  I have an  In-
dulgence."
       It  was an  answer that  appalled the most sceptical of
us, and we fellt  individually that  in  the presence of such
earnesst  purpose as the  Professor's, a  purpose which could
thus use the to  him most sacred of things, it was impossible
to distrrust.In respectful silence we took the places assign-

ed to us close round the tomb,  but hidden from the sight of
any one appproaching.  I pitied the others, especially Arthur.
II had myself  been apprenticed  by  my former visits to this
watching hoorror, and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repud-
iatted the proofs,  felt my heart sink within  me.  Never did
tombs look soo ghastly  white.  Never did cypress, or yew, or
junipper so seem the embodiment of  funeral gloom.  Never did
tree or grass wwave or  rustle so ominously.  Never did bough
creak sso mysteriously, and never did the far-away howling of
dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.
      There  was a long  spell of silence, big, aching, void,
and then frrom the  Professor a  keen "S-s-s-s!"  He pointed,
andd far down the  avenue  of  yews we saw a white figure ad-
vance, a dim  white figure, which  held something dark at its
breasst. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moon-
light  fell upoon the masses of driving clouds, and showed in
startliing  prominence  a  dark-haired woman,  dressed in the
cerements of the  grave.  We could not  see the face, for it
was bent  down over what we saw to  be  a  fair-haired child.
TThere was a  pause and  a  sharp little cry, such as a child
gives  in   sleep,  or  a dog  as it lies before the fire and
dreeams.  We were starting forward, but the Professor's warn-
ing hand, seeen by us as he stood behind a yew tree, kept  us
back..  And then as we looked the white figure moved forwards
again. It was nnow near enough for us to see clearly, and the
moonligght still held.  My own heart grew cold as ice,  and I
could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognized the features
of Lucy WWestenra.  Lucy Westenra, but yet  how changed.  The
ssweetness was turned  to adamantine,  heartless cruelty, and
the purity  to voluptuous wantonness.
     Van  Helsing stepped out,and obedient to his gesture, we
aall advanced too. The four of us ranged in a line before the
door of  thhe tomb.  Van Helsing  raised his lantern and drew
thee slide.  By  the  concentrated  light that fell on Lucy's
face  we  couuld see that  the  lips  were crimson with fresh
bloodd, and that  the  stream  had trickled over her chin and
stained the purrity of her lawn death robe.
     Wee shuddered with horror.  I could see by the tremulous
light that even Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed.  Arthur
was next  to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him
uup, he would have fallen.
     When  Lucy, I call the thing that was before us Lucy be-
caause it bore her shape, saw  us she drew back with an angry
snarl,such aas a cat gives when taken unawares, then her eyes
rangged  over us.  Lucy's eyes in  form and color, but Lucy's
eyes unclean   and full of hell fire, instead  of  the  pure,
gentlee orbs we knew.  At that moment the  remnant of my love
passed into hatee and loathing.  Had she then to be killed, I
could haave done it with savage delight.  As she looked,  her

eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became  wreathed
with a volluptuous smile.  Oh, God, how it made me shudder to
seee it!  With a careless motion, she  flung  to  the ground,
callous as aa devil,the child that up to now she had clutched
streenuously to her breast,  growling over it as a dog growls
over a bone. TThe child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moan-
ing.   There was a  cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a
groan from Arthuur.When she advanced to him with outstretched
arms andd a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his

hands.
     She sstill advanced, however, and with a languorous, vol-
uuptuous grace, said, "Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others
and come too me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can
resst together.  Come, my husband, come!"
     There  wass  something  diabolically sweet in her tones,
somethiing of  the tinkling of glass  when struck, which rang
through the brains even  of us who heard the words addressed
to anotheer.
     As for Arrthur,he seemed under a spell, moving his hands
from hhis face, he opened wide his arms.  She was leaping for
them, when Van HHelsing  sprang forward and held between them
his litttle golden crucifix.  She recoiled from it, and, with

a suddenly distorted  face, full of rage, dashed past him as
if to enteer the tomb.
      When within a foot or two of the door,however,she stop-
ped, as if arreested  by some  irresistible  force.  Then she
turned,, and  her  face was shown in the clear burst of moon-
light and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Hel-
sing's neerves.Never did I see such baffled malice on a face,
aand never,  I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal
eyes.  The  beautiful color became  livid, the eyes seemed to
thrrow out sparks of hell  fire, the  brows were  wrinkled as
though the foolds of flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes,
and tthe lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an  open square,
as in the passiion masks of the Greeks and Japanese.  If ever
a face  meant death, if looks could  kill, we  saw it at that
moment.
     Andd so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity,
se remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred clos-
ing of heer means of entry.
     Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur, "Answer
me, oh myy friend!  Am I to proceed in my work?"
     "Do as yoou will, friend.  Do as you will.  There can be
no horrror like this ever any more." And he groaned in spirit.
     Quincey annd I simultaneously moved towards him,and took
his armms.  We could hear the click of the closing lantern as
Van Helsing held it down. Coming close to the tomb, he began
to removee from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he
hhad placed there. We all looked on  with horrified amazement
as we  saw,, when he stood  back, the woman, with a corporeal
boddy  as  real  at that moment  as our own, pass through the
interstice whhere scarce a knife blade could have gone.We all
felt  a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly
restoring the sstrings of putty to the edges of the door.
     When tthis was done, he lifted the child and said, "Come
noww, my friends.  We can do no more till tomorrow.  There is
a funeral at  noon, so  here  we shall  all come  before long
afterr that.  The friends of the dead will all be gone by two,
and when the ssexton  locks the  gate  we shall remain.  Then
there  is more to do, but not like this  of  tonight.  As for
this little one,,  he is  not  much  harmed, and by  tomorrow
night hee shall be well.  We shall leave him where the police

will find him, as on the other night, and then to home."
     Coming cllose to Arthur, he said, "My friend Arthur, you
have hhad a  sore trial,  but  after, when you look back, you
will  see  how iit was necessary.  You  are now in the bitter
waters,   my  child.  By  this time tomorrow you will, please

God,  have passed  them, and have drunk of the sweet waters.
So do not  mourn over-much.  Till then I shall not ask you to
foorgive me."
     AArthur  and Quincey  came home with me, and we tried to
cheer each otherr on the  way.  We had left  behind the child
in safetty, and were tired. So we all slept with more or less

reality of sleep.

     29 Septembber, night.--A little before twelve o'clock we
three,   Arthur, Quincey Morris,  and myself,  called for the
Professor.  It was  odd to  notice that by common consent we
had all pput on black clothes.  Of course, Arthur wore black,
ffor  he was in deep  mourning, but the rest of us wore it by
instinct.   We  got  to  the  graveyard by half-past one, and
strrolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that
when  the graavediggers had completed their task and the sex-
ton uunder the belief that every one had gone, had locked the
gate, we had thhe place all to ourselves.Van Helsing, instead
of his  little black bag,had with him a long leather one,some-
thing like a criicketing bag.It was manifestly of fair weight.
     Whhen  we  were alone and had heard the last of the foot-
steps die out upp the road, we silently, and as if by ordered
intentioon, followed the  Professor to the tomb.  He unlocked

the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he took
from  his  bag  the  lantern,  which he lit, and also two wax
caandles, which, when lighted, he stuck by  melting their own
ends, on othher coffins, so  that they might give light suff-
icieent to work by.  When  he again lifted the lid off Lucy's
coffin we all  looked, Arthur trembling like an aspen,and saw
that tthe corpse lay there in all its death beauty. But there
was no love in mmy own heart,  nothing  but loathing  for the
foul Thiing which had taken Lucy's shape without her soul.  I

could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked.Present-
ly he saidd to Van Helsing,  "Is this  really Lucy's body, or
onnly a demon in her shape?"
     "It  is her body, and yet not it.  But wait a while, and
yyou shall see her as she was, and is."
     She  seemeed  like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there,
the poiinted  teeth,  the  blood  stained,  voluptuous mouth,
which made one shudder to see,the whole carnal and unspirit-
ed  appeaarance,  seeming  like  a devilish mockery of Lucy's
ssweet purity.  Van Helsing, with his  usual  methodicalness,
began takinng the  various contents from  his bag and placing
theem ready  for use.  First he took out a soldering iron and
some plumbingg solder,and then small oil lamp, which gave out,
whenn lit  in  a  corner of  the tomb, gas which  burned at a
fierce  heat wwith a  blue  flame, then his operating knives,
which  he placed to hand, and last a round wooden stake, some
two and  a half  or three inches  thick  and about three feet
long.  OOne  end  of it was hardened by charring in the fire,

and was sharpened  to a fine  point.  With this stake came a
heavy hammmer,  such  as in  households  is  used in the coal
ceellar for breaking the lumps.To me, a doctor's preperations
for work of  any kind  are stimulating and  bracing, but  the
effeect  of  these things  on  both Arthur and Quincey was to
cause them a ssort of consternation. They both, however, kept
their  courage, and remained silent and quiet.
     When alll was ready, Van Helsing said,"Before we do any-
thingg, let me tell you this.  It is out of the lore  and ex-
perience of thee ancients  and of all those  who have studied
the powwers of the Un-Dead. When they become such,there comes
with the change the curse of immortality.  They  cannot die,
but  mustt  go on age after age adding new victims and multi-
pplying the evils of the world.  For all  that die  from  the
preying of  the Un-dead become themselves Un-dead,and prey on
theeir kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as
the ripples ffrom a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur,
if yoou had met that kiss which you know of  before poor Lucy
die, or again,llast night when you open your arms to her, you
would iin time, when you had died, have become  nosferatu, as
they  call it in Eastern europe, and would for all time make
more of tthose  Un-Deads that so have filled  us with horror.
TThe career  of this  so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.
Those childdren whose blood she sucked are not as yet so much
thee worse,  but if she lives on, Un-Dead, more and more they
lose their bllood and by her power over them they come to her,
and  so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth.But if
she die in truuth, then all cease.  The tiny  wounds  of  the
throatts disappear, and they go back to their play  unknowing
ever of what hass been.  But of the most blessed of all, when
this noww Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul

of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free.Instead of
working wiickedness by night and growing  more debased in the
asssimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the
other Angelss.  So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand
for  her that shall strike the blow that  sets her  free.  To
this I am willling, but  is there none  amongst us who  has a
betterr right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the
silence of the nnight when sleep is not, `It was my hand that
sent herr to the stars. It was the hand of him that loved her

best,the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had
it been too her to choose?'  Tell  me if  there be such a one
ammongst us?"
     WWe  all looked  at Arthur. He saw too, what we all did,
the infinite kinndness which suggested that his should be the
hand  whhich  would  restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an

unholy, memory.  He stepped forward and said bravely, though
his hand ttrembled,and his face was as pale as snow, "My true
frriend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell
me what I amm to do, and I shall not falter!"
      Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder,and said,"Brave
lad!  A momeent's courage, and it is done. This stake must be
drivven through her.  It well be a fearful ordeal, be not de-
ceived in thatt, but  it  will  be only a short time, and you
will tthen rejoice more than your pain was great.  From  this
grim tomb you wiill emerge as though  you tread  on air.  But
you mustt not falter when once you have begun.Only think that

we, your true friends, are round you, and  that  we pray for
you all thhe time."
     "Goo on,"said Arthur hoarsely."Tell me what I am to do."

     "Take this  stake in  your left hand, ready to place to
the point  over the heart, and the hammer in your right. Then
whhen we  begin our prayer for  the dead, I shall read him, I
have here  tthe book,  and the others shall follow, strike in
God''s name,  that so all may be  well  with the dead that we
love and that  the Un-Dead pass away."
    Arthur  took the  stake and the hammer, and when once his
minnd was  set  on action  his  hands never trembled nor even
quivered.  Vaan Helsing  opened his missal and began to read,
and QQuincey and I followed as well as we could.
     Arthuur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked
I  could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with
all his mighht.
     The thingg  in the coffin writhed, and a hideous, blood-
curdliing  screech  came from  the opened red lips.  The body
shook and  quiveered and  twisted  in  wild contortions.  The
sharp whhite champed together till the lips were cut, and the

mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur never fal-
tered.  Hee looked like a figure of Thor as  his  untrembling
arrm rose and  fell,  driving deeper and  deeper  the  mercy-
bearing stakke, whilst the blood from the pierced heart well-
ed   and spurted  up around  it.  His face  was set, and high
duty seemed too shine through it.  The  sight  of  it gave us
couragge so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
vault.
     Andnd  then the writhing and quivering of the body became

less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver.
Finally itt lay still.  The terrible task was over.
     The hammmer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would
havee fallen had we not caught him.  The great drops of sweat
sprang from hiis forehead,and his breath came in broken gasps.
It haad indeed been an awful strain on him, and  had  he  not
been forced to  his task by more than human considerations he
could nnever have gone through with it.  For a few minutes we
were so taken up with him that we did not look  towards  the
coffin.   When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise
rran from one to the other of us.  We gazed so  eagerly  that
Arthur rosee, for he had been seated on  the ground, and came
andd looked too, and then a glad strange light broke over his
face and disppelled altogether the gloom of  horror  that lay
upon  it.
     There,   in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that
we haas so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her de-
struction was yyielded as a privilege to the one  best entit-
led to  it, but Lucy as we had seen her in life,with her face
of unequalled  sweetness  and purity.  True that there  were
there, ass we had seen them in life, the traces of  care  and
ppain and waste.  But these were all dear  to  us,  for  they
marked her  truth to what we knew.  One  and all we felt that
thee  holy calm that lay like sunshine over the  wasted  face
and form was  only an earthly token  and symbol of  the  calm
that  was to reign for ever.
     Van Hellsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder,
andd said to him,  "And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I
not forgiven??"
     The reactiion of the terrible strain came as he took the
old mann's hand in his,and raising it to his lips, pressed it,
and said,  "Forggiven!   God bless you that you have given my
dear onee her soul again, and me peace."  He put his hands on

the Professor's shoulder, and laying his head on his breast,
cried for  a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving.
     Whenn  he  raised his head Van Helsing said to him, "And
nnow, my child, you  may kiss her.  Kiss her dead lips if you
will, as shhe would  have  you to, if for her to choose.  For
shee is not a  grinning  devil now, not any more a foul Thing
for all eternnity. No longer she is the devil's Un-Dead.  She
is Good's true dead, whose soul is with Him!"
     Arthur   bent  and kissed her, and then we  sent him and
Quinccey out of the tomb.  The Professor and I sawed the  top
off the stake,  leaving the point of it in the body.  Then we
cut offf the head and filled the mouth with garlic.  We sold-
ered up the leaden  coffin, screwed on the  coffin lid,  and
gatheringg up  our belongings, came away.  When the Professor
llocked the door he gave the key to Arthur.
     Outsidde the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds
sanng, and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a differ-
ent pitch.Theere was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere,
for wwe were  at rest ourselves  on  one account, and we were
glad, though itt was with a tempered joy.
     Befoore we moved away Van Helsing said,"Now, my friends,
oone step or our work is done, one the most harrowing to our-
selves.  Buut there remains a greater task, to  find  out the
autthor of all this or sorrow and  to stamp him out.  I  have
clues which wwe can follow, but it is a long task,and a diff-
icultt one, and there is danger in it, and pain.Shall you not
all help me?  WWe have learned to believe, all of  us,  is it
not so??  And since so, do we not see our duty?  Yes!  And do
we not promise to go on to the bitter end?"
     Eacch in turn,we took his hand, and the promise was made.
Then said the  Professor as  we moved off, "Two nights hence
you shalll  meet  with  me and  dine together at seven of the
cclock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that
you  know nnot  as yet, and I  shall be ready to all our work
shoow and our plans  unfold.  Friend John,  you come  with me
home, for I hhave much to consult you about, and you can help
me. TTonight I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return tomorrow
night.  And theen begins our great quest.  But  first I shall
have muuch to say, so that you may know what  to  do  and  to
dread. Then our promise shall be made to each other anew.For
there is  a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on
tthe ploughshare we must not draw back."


CHAPTER 17 17

                   DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-cont

     W When we arrived at the Berkely Hotel, Van Helsing found
a telegram waitiing for him.
      "Am coming  up by train.  Jonathan at Whitby. Important
news.  Mina Harrker."

     The e Professor was delighted.  "Ah, that wonderful Madam
MMina,"  he said, "pearl among women!  She arrive, but I can-
not stay.   She  must go to your house, friend John. You must
meeet her at the station.  Telegraph her en route so that she
may be preparred."
     When thhe wire was dispatched he had a cup of tea.  Over
it hhe told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad,
and gave me aa typewritten copy of it,as also of Mrs.Harker's
diaryy at Whitby. "Take these," he said,"and study them well.
When I have  reeturned you  will be master  of all the facts,
and we  can then  better  enter on our inquisition. Keep them
safe, for  there is in them much of treasure.  You will need
all  yourr faith, even you who have had such an experience as
tthat of today.  What is here told," he laid his hand heavily
and gravelyy on the packet of papers as he spoke, "may be the
begginning  of  the end to you and me and many another, or it
may sound thee knell of the Un-Dead who walk the earth.  Read
all,  I pray you,  with the open  mind, and if you can add in
any way to the  story here told  do so, for it is all import-
ant.  YYou have kept a diary of all  these so strange things,
is it not so?  Yes!  Then we shall go  through all these to-
gether whhen we meet."  He then made ready  for his departure
aand shortly drove off to Liverpool Street. I took my way  to
Paddington,, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the
traain came in.
      The crowd melted away,  after the bustling fashion com-
mon to arrival  platforms,and I was beginning to feel uneasy,
lest I  might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty look-
ing girl stepped up to me, and after a  quick  glance  said,
"Dr. Sewaard, is it not?"
      "And  you  are Mrs. Harker!" I answered at once, where-
upon she heeld out her hand.

     "I knew  you  from  the  description of poor dear Lucy,
but. . ."  She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread
heer face.
     The  blush that rose to  my own  cheeks  somehow  set us
bboth at ease,for it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her
luggage, whhich included a typewriter, and we took the Under-
groound to Fenchurch Street, after I had  sent a wire  to  my
housekeeper tto have a sitting room and a bedroom prepared at
once  for Mrs. Harker.

     In  due time we arrived.  She knew, of course, that the
place was  a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was un-
abble to repress a shudder when we entered.
     She tolld me that,if she might, she would come presently
to mmy study, as she had much to say.  So here I am finishing
my entry in myy phonograph  diary whilst I await her.  As yet
I havee not had the chance of looking at the papers which Van
Helsing left witth me, though they lie open before me. I must
get her  interested in something, so that I may have an  opp-

ortunity of reading them.  She does  not know  how  precious
time is, oor what a task we have  in hand.  I must be careful
noot to frighten her.  Here she is!


 MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL
     29 Septtember.--After  I had  tidied myself, I went down
to DDr. Seward's study.  At the door I paused a moment, for I
thought I hearrd him talking with some one.  As, however,  he
had prressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door,and on his
calling out, "Coome in," I entered.
     To my  inteense  surprise, there was no one with him. He
was quitte alone, and on  the  table  opposite him was what I

knew at once from the description to be a phonograph.  I had
never seenn one, and was much interested.
      "I hope I did not keep you waiting,"   I said,  "but  I
stayed at the  door as I heard you talking, and thought there
was soomeone with you."

     "Oh," he replied with a smile,  "I was only entering my
diary."
 
     "Your diary?"  I asked him in surprise.
     "Yess,"  he answered.  "I keep it in this."  As he spoke
hhe laid his hand on the phonograph.  I  felt  quite  excited
over it, annd blurted out,  "Why,  this beats even shorthand!
Mayy I hear it say something?"
     "Ceertainly," he replied with alacrity,  and stood up to

put it in train for speaking.  Then he paused, and a troubl-
ed look ovverspread his face.
     "The fact iis," he began awkwardly."I only keep my diary
in it, aand as it is entirely, almost entirely,about my cases

it may be awkward, that is, I mean  . . ." He stopped, and I
tried to hhelp him out of his embarrassment.
      "You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear
how she dieed, for all that I know of her,  I shall  be  very
graateful.  She was very, very dear to me."
     To my suurprise,he answered, with a horrorstruck look in
his fface,  "Tell you of her death?  Not for the wide world!"
     "Why not?""  I asked, for some grave,  terrible  feeling
was comming over me.
      Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying  to
invent an excuuse.  At length, he stammered out,  "You see, I
do  noot  know  how to pick  out  any  particular part of the
diary."
     EvEven while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and
he said with unconscious simplicity, in a  different  voice,
and with  the naivete of a child, "that's quite true, upon my
hhonor.  Honest Indian!"
     I couldd not but smile, at which he grimaced."I gave my-
selff away that time!"  he said.  "But do you know that,  al-
though I have  kept the diary for months past,  it never once
struckk me how I was going to find any  particular part of it
in case I wantedd to look it up?"

     By this time my mind was made up  that the  diary of  a
doctor whoo attended Lucy might  have something to add to the
suum of our knowledge  of that  terrible  Being,  and  I said
boldly, "Theen, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out
for  you on my typewriter."
     He greww to a positively deathly pallor as he said, "No!
No!   No!  For all the  world.  I wouldn't  let you know that
terrible storyy.!"
     Then it  was terrible. My intuition was right! For a mo-
ment,, I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room,unconscious-
ly looking for  something or some opportunity to aid me, they
lit on  a great batch of typewriting on the table.   His eyes
caught the look in mine, and without his  thinking, followed
their dirrection. As they saw the parcel he realized my mean-
iing.
     "You do  not know me," I said. "When you have read those
paperrs, my own diary and my husband's  also,  which  I  have
typed, you willl know me better.  I have not faltered in giv-
ing eveery thought of my own heart in  this cause.   But,  of
course, you do not know me, yet, and I must  not expect  you
to trust  me so far."
      He is certainly a man of noble nature.   Poor dear Lucy
was right aboutt him.  He stood up and opened a large drawer,
in whicch were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders
of metal covered with dark wax, and said,
     "You  are quite right. I did not trust you because I did
noot know you.  But I know you now, and  let  me say  that  I
should have  known you long ago. I know that Lucy told you of
me.   She told me of you too.  May I make  the only atonement
in my power?   Take the cylinders and hear them.   The  first
half-ddozen  of them are personal to me,  and  they will  not
horrify you.  Thhen you will know me better.  Dinner  will by
then be  ready.  In the meantime I shall  read over  some  of

these documents, and shall be better able to understand cer-
tain thinggs."
     He carriied the phonograph himself up to my sitting room
and aadjusted it for me.Now I shall learn something pleasant,
I am sure. For  it will tell me the other side of a true love
episodee of which I know one side already.


 DR. SEWARD'S DIIARY

     29 Sepeptember.--I was  so  absorbed  in  that  wonderful
diaary of Jonathan Harker and that other of  his wife that  I
let the time  run on without thinking.  Mrs. Harker  was  not
down  when the maid came to announce dinner, so I said,  "She
is possibly tirred.  Let dinner wait an hour,"  and I went on
with myy work.  I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when
she came in.  She looked sweetly pretty, but very  sad,  and
her eyes  were flushed with crying.   This  somehow moved  me
mmuch.  Of late I have had cause for tears, God  knows!   But
the relief  of them was denied me, and now the sight of those
sweeet eyes, brightened by recent tears, went straight to  my
heart.  So I  said as gently as I could,  "I greatly  fear  I
have  distressed you."

     "Oh, no, not distressed me,"  she replied.  "But I have
been more  touched than I can say by your grief.  That  is  a
woonderful machine, but it is cruelly true.   It told me,  in
its very tonnes, the anguish of your heart.It was like a soul
cryiing out to Almighty God.  No  one must hear  them  spoken
ever again!  SSee, I have tried to  be useful.  I have copied
out thhe words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear
your heart beat,, as I did."
      "No one need ever know, shall ever know,"  I  said in a
low voice.  Shee laid her hand on mine and said very gravely,
"Ah, buut they must!"
      "Must!  but why?"  I asked.
      "Because it is a part of the terrible story,  a part of
poor Lucy's deaath and all that led to  it.  Because  in  the
strugglle which we have before us  to rid  the earth  of this
terrible monster we must have all the  knowledge and all the
help whicch we can get.  I think that the cylinders which you
ggave me contained more than you intended me to know.  But  I
can see thaat there are in  your record many  lights  to this
darrk mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all
up to a certaain point, and I see already,  though your diary
only  took me to 7  September, how poor Lucy was  beset,  and
how her terriblle doom was being wrought out.  Jonathan and I
have beeen working day and night since Professor  Van Helsing
saw us.  He is gone to Whitby to  get more information,  and
he will bbe here tomorrow to help us. We need have no secrets
aamongst us.  Working together  and with  absolute trust,  we
can surely  be stronger than if some of us were in the dark."
      She looked at me so appealingly, and at  the  same time
manifested suuch courage and resolution  in her bearing, that
I gavve in at once to her wishes. "You shall," I said, "do as
you like in thee matter.  God forgive me if I do wrong! There
are terrrible things yet to learn of.  But if you have so far
traveled on the road to poor Lucy's death, you  will not  be
content,  I know, to remain in the dark.   Nay, the end,  the
vvery end, may give you a gleam  of  peace.  Come,  there  is
dinner.  Wee must keep one another strong  for what is before
us..  We have a cruel and dreadful task.  When you have eaten
you shall leaarn the rest,  and I shall answer any  questions
you aask, if there be anything which you do  not  understand,
though it was aapparent to us who were present."


MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

     29 Sepeptember.--After  dinner  I came with Dr. Seward to
hiss study.  He brought back the phonograph from my room, and
I took a chaiir, and arranged the phonograph  so that I could
touchh it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in
case I should wwant to pause.  Then he very thoughtfully took
a chairr, with his back to me, so that I might be as  free as
possible, and began to read.  I put  the forked  metal to my
ears and  listened.
     Whhen the terrible story of Lucy's  death,  and all that
followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless.  Fort-
unately II am not of a fainting disposition.  When Dr. Seward
ssaw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation,  and hurr-
iedly takinng a case bottle from  the cupboard,  gave me some
braandy, which in a few  minutes  somewhat restored  me.   My
brain was alll in a whirl, and only  that  there came through
all tthe multitude of horrors, the holy  ray of light that my
dear Lucy was aat last at peace, I do not think I could  have
borne iit without making a scene.  It is all so wild and mys-
terious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan's  ex-
perience  in Transylvania I could not  have  believed.  As it
wwas, I didn't know what to believe,  and  so got  out  of my
difficulty  by attending to something else.  I took the cover
offf my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward,
     "Let me  write this all out now.  We  must be  ready for
Dr. VVan Helsing when he comes.  I have sent  a  telegram  to
Jonathan  to  ccome  on here  when  he arrives in London from
Whitby..  In this matter dates  are everything, and  I  think
that if we get all of our material ready,and have every item
put in chhronological order, we shall have done much.
     "Youu tell me that  Lord Godalming  and  Mr. Morris  are
ccoming too.  Let us be able to tell them when they come."
     He accorddingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I
began  to typewrite from the beginning of the seventeenth cy-
linder.  I used   manifold, and so took three copies  of  the
diary, jjust as I had done with the rest.  It was late when I

got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his
round of tthe patients. When he had finished he came back and
saat  near  me,  reading,  so  that I did not feel too lonely
whilst I worrked.  How good and thoughtful he is.  The  world
seemms full of good men, even if there are monsters in it.
     Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his
diary of  the Professor's perturbation  at reading  something
iin an evening paper  at the  station at Exeter,  so,  seeing
that Dr. Seeward keeps  his newspapers,  I borrowed the files
of  `The Westminster Gazette' and `The Pall Mall Gazette' and
took them to  my room.  I remember how much the  `Dailygraph'
and ``The Whitby Gazette', of which I had made cuttings,  had
helped us to unnderstand the terrible events  at  Whitby when
Count DDracula landed, so I shall look  through  the  evening
papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light. I
am not slleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.

 DR.R. SEWARD'S DIARY


     30 September.--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock.   He
got his wwife's wire just before starting.  He is  uncommonly
cclever, if one can judge from his face, and full of  energy.
If this jouurnal be true, and judging by one's  own wonderful
expperiences, it must be, he is also a  man  of great  nerve.
That going doown to the vault a second time was a  remarkable
piecee of daring.  After reading his account of it I was pre-
pared to meet aa good specimen  of  manhood,  but hardly  the
quiet,  business-like gentleman who came here today.

     L LATER.--After lunch Harker and his wife  went  back  to
their own room,aand as I passed a while ago I heard the click
of the ttypewriter.  They are hard at it.  Mrs.  Harker  says

that knitting together in chronological order every scrap of
evidence tthey have.  Harker has got the letters between  the
coonsignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in  London
who took chaarge of them.  He is now reading his wife's tran-
scriipt of my diary.  I wonder what they make out of it. Here
it is . . .


     Strange that it never  struck me  that  the  very  next
house migght be the Count's hiding place! Goodness knows that
wwe had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield!
The bundlee of letters relating to the purchase of the  house
weere with the transcript.  Oh, if we had only had them earl-
ier we mightt have saved poor Lucy!  Stop! That  way  madness
liess! Harker has gone back, and is again collecting material.
He says that  by dinner  time  they  will  be  able to show a
wholee connected narrative.  He thinks that in the meantime I
should see Renffield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index
to the  coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,
but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall.  What  a good
thing thaat Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type!  We never
ccould have found the dates otherwise.
     I found Rennfield sitting placidly in his room with  his
hands foolded, smiling benignly.  At the moment he  seemed as

sane as any one I ever saw.  I sat down and talked with  him
on a lot oof subjects, all of which he treated naturally.  He
thhen, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a  subject  he
has never meentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here.
In ffact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge
at once.  I beelieve that, had I not had the chat with Harker
and reead the letters and the dates of his outbursts,I should
have been preparred to sign for him after a brief time of ob-
servatioon.  As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All those out-

breaks were in some way linked with  the  proximity  of  the
Count.  Whhat then does this absolute content mean? Can it be
thhat his instinct is satisfied as to the  vampire's ultimate
triumph?  Sttay.  He is himself zoophagous, and  in his  wild
raviings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he al-
ways spoke of  `master'.  This all seems  confirmation of our
idea.   However, after a while I came away. My friend is just
a little too sanne at present to make it safe  to  probe  him
too  deeep  with  questions.  He  might  begin  to think, and

then . . . So I came away.  I mistrust these quiet  moods of
of his, soo I have given the attendant a hint to look closely
affter him, and to have a strait waistcoat  ready in case  of
need.

          JOHNATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

       29 September, in train to London.--When I received  Mr.
Billington'ss courteous message that he would give me any in-
formmation in his power I thought it best to go down to Whit-
by and make, oon the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was
now myy object to trace that horrid cargo of the  Count's  to
its place in Lonndon. Later, we may be able to deal  with it.
Billingtton junior, a nice lad, met me  at the  station,  and

brought me to his father's house,where they had decided that
I must speend the night. They are hospitable, with true York-
shhire hospitality, give a  guest  everything and  leave  him
to do as he  likes.  They all knew that I  was busy, and that
my sstay was short, and Mr.Billington had ready in his office
all the paperss concerning the consignment of boxes.  It gave
me almmost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
seen on the Counnt's table before I knew  of  his  diabolical
plans.   Everything had been carefully thought out, and  done

systematically and with precision.  He  seemed to  have been
prepared ffor every obstacle  which might be placed by  acci-
deent in the way of his intentions being carried out.  To use
and Americannism, he had `taken no chances', and the absolute
accuuracy  with  which  his instructions  were fulfilled  was
simply the loggical result of his care. I saw the invoice,and
took nnote of it.`Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for
experimental purrposes'.  Also the copy of the letter to Car-
ter Pateerson, and their reply.  Of both these I  got copies.

This was all the information Mr.Billington could give me, so
I went dowwn to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
Offficers and the harbor master, who kindly put me in commun-
ication withh the men who had  actually  received  the boxes.
Theiir tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to
add to the simmple description `fifty cases of common earth',
exceptt that the boxes were `main and mortal heavy', and that
shifting them waas dry work.  One of them  added that it  was
hard linnes that there wasn't any  gentleman  `such  like  as

like yourself, squire', to show some sort of appreciation of
their effoorts in a liquid form.  Another put in a rider that
thhe thirst then generated was such that even the time  which
had elapsed  had not completely allayed it.  Needless to add,
I toook care before leaving to lift, forever and  adequately,
this source off reproach.
       30 September.--The station master was  good enough  to
give me a line tto his old companion the  station  master  at
King's CCross, so that when I arrived  there in the morning I

was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes.  He, too
put me at  once in communication with  the proper  officials,
annd I saw that their tally was correct with the original in-
voice. The oopportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had
beenn here limited.  A noble use of them  had, however,  been
made, and agaiin I was compelled to deal with  the  result in
ex posst facto manner.
      From thence I went to Carter Paterson's central office,
where I mett with the utmost courtesy.   They looked  up  the
traansaction in their day book  and letter book, and at  once
telephoned too their King's Cross office for more details. By
good   fortune,  the men who did the teaming were waiting for
work, and the oofficial at once sent them over, sending  also
by one   of  them  the way-bill and all  the papers connected
with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found
the tallyy agreeing exactly.  The carriers' men were able  to
ssupplement the paucity of the written words with a few  more
details. Thhese were, I shortly found, connected almost sole-
ly   with the  dusty  nature  of  the job, and the consequent
thirst engenddered in the operators.  On my affording an opp-
ortunnity,  through the medium of the currency of  the realm,
of the allayingg, at a later  period, this  beneficial  evil,
one of  the men remarked,
     "That `ere `ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I  ever  was
in.  Blymme! But it ain't been touched sence a hundred years.
TThere was dust that thick in the place  that you  might have
slep' on itt without `urtin' of yer bones.  An' the place was
thaat neglected that yer might `ave smelled ole Jerusalem  in
it.  But the  old chapel, that took the cike, that did!Me and
my maate,  we  thort  we wouldn't never git out quick enough.
Lor', I wouldn''t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there
arter ddark."
     Havingg been in the house, I could well believe him, but
if  he  knew what I  know,  he would, I think have raised his
terms.
       Of one thing I am now satisfied.  That all those  boxes
which arrived aat Whitby from Varna in the Demeter were safe-
ly depoosited in the old chapel at Carfax.  There  should  be
fifty of them there, unless any have since  been removed, as
from Dr.  Seward's diary I fear.

     Laterer.--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put
alll the papers into order.

 MINA HAHARKER'S JOURNAL


     30 September.--I am so glad that I hardly  know how  to
contain  mmyself.  It  is,  I  suppose, the reaction from the
haaunting fear which I have had,that this terrible affair and
the reopeninng of his old wound  might  act detrimentally  on
Jonaathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as
could, but  I   was  sick with apprehension.  The effort has,
howeveer, done him good.  He was never so resolute,  never so
strong, never soo full of volcanic energy, as at present.  It
is just  as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said, he is

true grit, and he improves under strain that  would  kill  a
weaker natture. He came back full of life and hope and deter-
miination.  We have got everything in order for  tonight.   I
feel myself  quite wild with excitement.  I suppose one ought
to ppity anything so hunted as the Count.  That is  just  it.
This thing is  not human, not even a beast.  To read Dr. Sew-
ard's  account of poor Lucy's  death, and  what followed,  is
enough to dry upp the springs of pity in one's heart.

     Later.--L-Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris  arrived  earlier
than wwe expected.  Dr. Seward was out on business,  and  had
taken Jonathan wwith him, so I had to see them.  It was to me
a painfuul meeting, for it brought back all poor dear  Lucy's

hopes of only a few months ago.  Of  course  they had  heard
Lucy speakk of me, and it seemed that  Dr. Van Helsing,  too,
haad been quite `blowing my trumpet', as Mr. Morris expressed
it.  Poor feellows, neither of them is aware that I know  all
abouut the proposals they made to Lucy.  They did  not  quite
know what to ssay or do, as they  were ignorant of the amount
of my  knowledge.  So they had to keep on  neutral  subjects.
However, I thougght the matter over, and came to the conclus-
ion thatt the best thing I could do would be to post them  on

affairs right up to date.  I knew  from  Dr. Seward's  diary
that they  had been at Lucy's death, her real death, and that
I  need not fear to betray any secret before the time.  So  I
told them,ass well as I could, that I had read all the papers
and  diaries, and that my husband and I,  having  typewritten
them, had justt finished putting them in order.  I  gave them
each aa copy to read in the library.  When Lord Godalming got
his and turned iit over, it does make a pretty good pile,  he
said, "DDid you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"
     I nodded, aand he went on.
      "I don't quite see the drift of it, but you people  are
all so good  and kind, and have been working so earnestly and
so eenergetically, that all I can do is to accept  your ideas
blindfold and  try to help you. I have had one lesson already
in acccepting facts that should make a man humble to the last
hour of his lifee.  Besides, I know you loved my Lucy . . ."
     Heree he turned away and covered his face with his hands.

I could hear the tears in his voice.  Mr. Morris,  with  in-
stinctive   delicacy,  just  laid  a hand for a moment on his
shhoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room. I suppose
there is sommething in a woman's nature that makes a man free
to bbreak  down  before  her  and express his feelings on the
tender  or  emmotional  side without feeling it derogatory to
his maanhood.  For when  Lord Godalming  found himself  alone
with me he sat ddown on the sofa and gave way utterly and op-
enly.  II  sat  down beside him and took his hand.  I hope he

didn't think  it  forward of me, and that if her ever thinks
of it afteerwards he never will have such a thought.  There I
wrrong  him.  I know he never will.  He is too true a gentle-
man.I said tto him, for I could see that his heart was break-
ing,, "I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and
what you were  to her.  She and I were like sisters,  and now
she iss gone, will you not let me be like  a sister to you in
your trouble?  II know what sorrows you  have  had, though  I
cannot mmeasure the depth of them.  If sympathy and pity  can

help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some  little
service, ffor Lucy's sake?"

     In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with
grief.  Itt seemed to me that all that he had  of  late  been
suuffering in silence found a vent at once. He grew quite hy-
sterical,andd raising his open hands, beat his palms together
in aa perfect agony of grief.  He stood up and then sat  down
again, and thee tears rained down his cheeks.  I felt  an in-
finitee pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly.   With
a sob he laid hiis head on my shoulder and cried like a wear-
ied chilld, whilst he shook with emotion.
      We women have something of the mother in us  that makes
us rise abovve smaller matters when the mother spirit is  in-
vokeed.  I felt this big sorrowing man's head  resting on me,
as though it wwere that of a baby that some day may lie on my
bosom,, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child.
I never thoughtt at the time how strange it all was.
     After a litttle bit his sobs ceased, and  he raised him-
self witth an apology, though he made no disguise of his emo-

tion.  He told me that for days and nights past, weary  days
and sleeplless nights, he had been unable to  speak  with any
onne, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no
woman whose  sympathy could be given  to him, or  with  whom,
owinng to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
surrounded, hee could speak freely.
     "I know nnow how I suffered," he said, as  he dried  his
eyes,  "but I do not know even yet, and none other  can  ever
know, how much yyour sweet sympathy has been to  me today.  I
shall knnow better in time, and believe me that, though  I am

not ungrateful  now,  my  gratitude will grow with my under-
standing.   You will let me be like a brother, will  you not,
foor all our lives, for dear Lucy's sake?"
     "For deaar Lucy's sake," I said as we clasped hands."Ay,
and ffor your own sake," he added, "for if a man's esteem and
gratitude are eever worth the winning, you have won mine  to-
day.  IIf ever the future should bring to you a time when you
need a man's help,believe me, you will not call in vain. God
grant thaat no such time may ever come to you  to  break  the
ssunshine  of  your life, but if it should ever come, promise
me that youu will let me know."
     He was so  earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that  I
felt itt would comfort him, so I said, "I promise."
     As II came along the corridor I say  Mr. Morris  looking
oout of a window.  He turned as he heard my footsteps.   "How
is Art?" hee said. Then noticing my red eyes, he went on,"Ah,
I ssee you have been comforting him.  Poor  old  fellow!   He
needs it.  Noo one but a woman can help a man when  he is  in
troubble of the heart, and he had no one to comfort him."
      He bore his own trouble so bravely that  my heart  bled
for him.  II saw the manuscript in his hand, and I  knew that
wheen he read it he would realize how  much I knew, so I said
to him,"I wissh I could comfort all who suffer from the heart.
Willl you let me be your friend, and will you come to me  for
comfort if youu need it?  You will know later why I speak."
     He  saw that I was in earnest,and stooping, took my hand,
and raising it to his lips, kissed it.  It seemed  but  poor
comfort tto so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively  I
bbent over and kissed him.  The tears rose in his  eyes,  and
there was aa momentary choking in his throat.  He said  quite
callmly,"Little girl, you will never forget that true hearted
kindness, so  long as ever you live!"  Then he went into  the
studyy to his friend.
      "Little girl!"  The very words he had used to Lucy, and,
oh, but hee proved himself a friend.

                    DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

       30 September.--I  got  home at  five o'clock, and found
that Godalming   and Morris  had  not only  arrived, but  had
alreadyy studied the transcript of  the various  diaries  and
letters which Harker had not  yet returned from his visit to
the carriiers' men,  of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me.
MMrs.Harker gave us a cup of tea,and I can honestly say that,
for the firrst time since I have lived in it,  this old house
seeemed  like home.  When we had finished, Mrs. Harker  said,
     "Dr.Sewaard, may I ask a favor?  I want to see your pat-
ient,, Mr. Renfield.  Do let me see him.  What  you have said
of him in your  diary interests me so much!"
     SShe  looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not
refuse her, and  there was no possible reason why I should,so
I took hher with me.When I went into the room, I told the man

that a lady would like to see him, to which he simply answer-
ed,  "Whyy?"
     "She is ggoing through the house, and wants to see every
one inn it," I answered.
     "Oh, very well," he said,"let her come in, by all means,
but justt wait a minute till I tidy up the place."
     His meethod of tidying was peculiar, he simply swallowed
alll the  flies  and spiders in the boxes before I could stop
him.  It was  quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of,
somee interference.  When he had got through  his  disgusting
task, he said   cheerfully,  "Let the lady come in," and  sat
down oon the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his
eyelids raised sso that he could see her as she entered.  For
a momentt I thought that he might have some homicidal intent.

I remembered how quiet he had been just  before  he attacked
me in my oown study, and I took care to stand  where I  could
seeize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her.
     She came  into the room  with an easy gracefulness which
would  at once command the respect of any lunatic,  for easi-
ness is one of tthe qualities mad people  most  respect.  She
walked oover to him,smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.
     "Good evening,  Mr. Renfield,"  said  she.  "You see, I
know you,, for Dr. Seward has told me of you."   He  made  no
iimmediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with  a  set
frown on hiis face. This look gave way to one of wonder,which
merrged in doubt, then to my intense  astonishment  he  said,
"You're not tthe girl the doctor wanted to marry,are you? You
can'tt be, you know, for she's dead."
      Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly  as she replied,  "Oh no!  I
have a husbannd of my own,to whom I was married before I ever
saw DDr. Seward, or he me.  I am Mrs. Harker."
     "Then wwhat are you doing here?"
     "My hhusband and I are staying on a visit with Dr.Seward."

     "Then don't stay."
     "But wwhy not?"
     I tthought  that this style of conversation might not be

pleasant  to  Mrs. Harker, any more  than it was to me, so I
joined in,,  "How did you know I wanted to marry anyone?"
     HHis reply was simply contemptuous,  given in a pause in
which he turned  his eyes from Mrs. Harker  to  me, instantly
turning  them back again,  "What an asinine question!"
     "II don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield,"said Mrs.Harker,
at once championning me.
     He rreplied to her with as much courtesy and respect  as
hhe had  shown  contempt to me,  "You will, of course, under-
stand, Mrs.. Harker, that when a man is so loved  and honored
as  our host is, everything regarding him is of  interest  in
our little coommunity.  Dr. Seward is loved not only  by  his
houseehold and his friends, but even by his patients, who, be-
ing some of thhem hardly in mental  equilibrium,  are apt  to
distorrt causes and effects.  Since I myself have been an in-
mate of a lunatiic asylum, I cannot but notice that the soph-
istic teendencies of some of its  inmates  lean  towards  the

errors of non causa and ignoratio elenche."
     I  ppositively  opened  my eyes at this new development.
HHere was my own pet lunatic, the most pronounced of his type
that I had  ever met with, talking elemental philosophy,  and
witth the manner of a polished gentleman.  I wonder if it was
Mrs. Harker'ss presence which had touched some  chord in  his
memorry. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due
to  her unconsccious influence, she must have some  rare gift
or poweer.
     We  contiinued to talk for some time, and seeing that he
was seeemingly  quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me
questioningly ass she began,to lead him to his favorite topic.
I was aagain astonished, for he addressed himself to the ques-
tion with the immpartiality of the completest sanity. He even
took himmself as an example when he mentioned certain things.

     "Why,I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange
belief.Inddeed,it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed,
annd insisted on my being put under control.  I used to fancy
that life waas a positive and perpetual entity, and  that  by
conssuming a multitude of live things, no  matter how low  in
the scale of ccreation, one might indefinitely prolong  life.
At timmes I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried
to take human liife.  The doctor here will bear  me  out that
on  one   occasion  I tried  to  kill  him for the purpose of

strengthening  my vital  powers by  the assimilation with my
own body oof his life through the medium of his blood,relying
off course, upon the Scriptural phrase, `For the blood is the
life.'  Thouugh, indeed,  the vendor of a certain nostrum has
vulggarized  the truism to the very point of contempt.  Isn't
that true, docctor?"
     I noddded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew
whaat to either  think or say,  it was hard to imagine that I
had seen him  eat  up  his spiders and flies not five minutes
beforre.  Looking at my watch,  I saw that I should go to the
station to meett Van Helsing, so  I  told Mrs. Harker that it
was timme to leave.
      She came at once,after saying pleasantly to Mr.Renfield,
"Goodbye,and II hope I may see you often, under auspices plea-
santeer to yourself."
      To which, to my astonishment, he replied,  "Goodbye, my
dear.  I prray God I may never see your sweet face again. May
He  bless and keep you!"
     When  I   went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left
the booys behind me.Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has
been since Lucy  first took ill, and Quincey is more like his
own brigght self than he has been for many a long day.
     Vaan Helsing  stepped  from  the carriage with the eager
nimbleness of a boy.  He saw me at once, and rushed up to me,
saying,   "Ah, friend John, how goes all?  Well?  So! I  have

been busy,for I come here to stay if need be.All affairs are
settled wiith me,and I have much to tell. Madam  Mina is with
yoou? Yes. And her so fine husband?  And Arthur and my friend
Quincey, theey are with you, too?  Good!"
     AAs  I drove to the house I told him of what had passed,
and of how my owwn  diary had  come to be of some use through
Mrs. Harrker's suggestion,at which  the Professor interrupted

me.
     "Ah, thaat wonderful Madam Mina!  She has man's brain, a
brainn that a man should  have were he much gifted, and a wo-
man's heart.Thee good God fashioned her for a purpose,believe
me, wheen He made that so good combination.Friend John, up to
now fortune has made that woman of help to us, after tonight
she must  not have to do with this so terrible affair.  It is
nnot good that she run a risk so great. We men are determined,
nay, are wwe not pledged, to destroy this monster?  But it is
noo part for a woman.Even if she be not harmed, her heart may
fail  her  iin so  much and so many horrors and hereafter she
may  suffer,both in waking,from her nerves, and in sleep,from
her dreams.  AAnd,  besides,  she is young woman and  not  so
long   married,  there  may be other things to think  of some
time,if not now..You tell me she has wrote all, then she must
consult  with us, but  tomorrow she say goodbye to this work,

and we go alone."
     I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
had foundd in his absence, that  the house which Dracula  had
bbought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a
great conceern seemed to come on him.
     "Oh  that we had known it before!" he said, "for then we
mmight have  reached him in time to save poor Lucy.  However,
`the milk tthat is spilt cries not out afterwards,'as you say.
Wee shall not think of that, but go on our way to  the  end."
Then he felll into a silence that lasted till we  entered  my
own  gateway.  Before we went to prepare for  dinner  he said
to Mrs. Harkerr,  "I am told, Madam Mina,  by my  friend John
that yyou and your husband have  put  up in exact  order  all
things that havee been, up to this moment."
     "Noot up to this moment, Professor,"she said impulsively,
"but up to this morning."
     "Buut why not up to now?  We have seen hitherto how good

light all the little things have made.  We have told our se-
crets, andd yet no one who has told is the worse for it."
     MMrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her
pockets, she  saaid,  "Dr. Van  Helsing,  will you read this,
and telll me if it must go in.  It is my record  of today.  I

too have seen the need of putting down at present everything,
however ttrivial, but there is little in this  except what is
ppersonal.  Must it go in?"
     The  Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back,
ssaying, "It need not go in if you do not wish it, but I pray
that it mayy. It can but make your husband love you the more,
andd all us, your friends, more honor you, as  well  as  more
esteem and loove."  She took it back with another blush and a
brighht smile.
     Andd so  now, up  to this very  hour, all the records we

have are complete and in order.  The Professor took away one
copy to sttudy after dinner, and before our meeting, which is
fiixed for  nine  o'clock.  The rest  of us have already read
everything,  so when we meet in the study we shall all be in-
formmed  as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with
this terrible  and mysterious enemy.

         MIMINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

      30 Septptember.--When we  met in  Dr. Seward's study two
hourss  after dinner, which had been at six o'clock,  we  un-
consciously forrmed a sort of board  or committee.  Professor
Van Hellsing took the head of the table,  to which Dr. Seward
motioned him as he came into the room.  He  made me sit next
to him onn his right, and asked me to act as secretary.  Jon-
aathan sat next to me.  Opposite us were  Lord Godalming, Dr.
Seward,  annd  Mr. Morris, Lord Godalming being next the Pro-
fesssor, and Dr. Seward in the center.

     The Professor said,  "I may, I suppose, take it that we
are all accquainted with the facts that are in these papers."
Wee  all expressed  assent, and he went on,  "Then it were, I
think,  goodd  that I tell you something of the kind of enemy
withh which we have to deal.  I shall  then make known to you
something of tthe history of this  man, which  has  been  as-
certaiined for me.  So we then  can discuss how we shall act,
and can take ourr measure according.
     "There aree such beings as vampires, some of us have ev-
idence   that  they  exist.  Even had we not the proof of our
own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the
past givee proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the
ffirst I was sceptic.  Were it not that through long years  I
have traineed  myself to  keep an open mind, I could not have
bellieved until such time as that fact thunder on my ear.`See!
See!  I provve, I prove.' Alas! Had I known at first what now
I knnow, nay, had I even guess at him, one so  precious  life
had been spareed to many of us who did love her.  But that is
gone,  and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not,
whilst we can saave.  The nosferatu  do not die like  the bee
when he  sting once. He is only stronger, and being stronger,

have yet more  power to work  evil.  This vampire  which  is
amongst uss is of himself so strong in person as  twenty men,
hee is of cunning more than mortal, for  his  cunning  be the
growth of agges, he have still the  aids of necromancy, which
is,  as his etymology imply, the divination by  the dead, and
all the dead tthat he can come nigh to are for him at command,
he iss brute, and more than brute,he is devil in callous, and
the heart of hiim is not, he can,within his range, direct the
elementts, the storm, the fog,the thunder, he can command all
the  meaner  things, the rat,  and the owl, and the bat, the
moth,and  the fox, and the wolf, he can grow and become small,

and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we
to begin oour strike to  destroy him?  How  shall we find his
whhere, and having found it, how can we destroy?  My friends,
this is  mucch,  it is a terrible task that we undertake, and
therre may  be consequence to make the brave shudder.  For if
we fail in thiis our fight he must surely win, and then where
end wee?  Life is nothings, I heed him not. But to fail here,
is not mere lifee or death. It is that we become as him, that
we  hencceforward  become foul things of  the night like him,

without  heart  or conscience, preying on the bodies and the
souls of tthose we love best.  To us forever are the gates of
heeaven shut, for who  shall open them to us again?  We go on
for all  timme  abhorred  by all, a blot on the face of God's
sunsshine, an arrow in the side of Him who died for man.  But
we  are  face   to face with  duty, and  in such case must we
shrinkk?  For me, I say no, but then I am old, and life, with
his sunshine, hiis  fair places, his song of birds, his music
and his  love, lie far  behind.  You others are  young.  Some

have seen sorrow, but there are fair days yet in store. What
say you?""
     Whilst  he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand.  I
feared,   oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger
wwas  overcoming him when I saw his  hand stretch out, but it
was life too me to feel its touch, so strong, so self reliant,
soo resolute.A brave man's hand can speak for itself, it does
not even neeed a woman's love to hear its music.
     When the Professor had done  speaking my husband looked
in my  eyyes,  and  I  in his, there was no need for speaking
bbetween us.
     ""I answer for Mina and myself," he said.
     "Count   me  in,  Professor,"  said  Mr. Quincey Morris,
laconnically as usual.

     "I am with you," said Lord Godalming, "for Lucy's sake,
if for no  other reason."
      Dr. Seward simply nodded.
     TThe Professor stood up and, after laying his golden cru-
cifix on the taable, held out his hand on either side. I took
his rigght hand, and Lord Godalming  his left, Jonathan  held
my right with his left and stretched across to Mr.Morris. So
as we alll took hands our solemn compact was made.  I felt my
hheart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back.
We resumedd our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went  on  with  a
soort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work  had
begun. It waas to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike
a waay, as any other transaction of life.
     "Well, you  know what we have to contend against, but we
too, aree not without strength.  We have on our side power of

combination, a  power  denied to the vampire kind,  we  have
sources off science, we are free to  act  and  think, and the
hoours of the day and the night are ours equally. In fact, so
far as our ppowers extend, they are unfettered,  and  we  are
freee to use them.We have self devotion in a cause and an end
to achieve whiich is not a selfish one. These things are much.
      "Now let  us see how far the general powers arrayed ag-
ainst us are reestrict, and how the individual cannot.In fine,
let uss consider the limitations of the  vampire in  general,
and of this one  in particular.
      "All  we  have to go upon are  traditions and supersti-
tions.These  do not at the first appear much, when the matter
is   one  of  life and death, nay of more than either life or
death.Yet mustt we be satisfied,in the first place because we
have tto be,  no other means is at our control, and secondly,
because, after aall these things, tradition and superstition,
are  eveerything.  Does  not  the belief in vampires rest for

others, though not, alas! for us, on them!  A year ago which
of us woulld have received such a possibility,in the midst of
ouur scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century?
We  even  sscouted  a  belief that we saw justified under our
verry eyes.  Take it, then, that the vampire, and  the belief
in his  limittations and his cure, rest for the moment on the
same  base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that
men have been.   In old Greece, in old Rome,  he  flourish in
Germanyy all over, in France, in India,even in the Chermosese,
and in China, soo far from us in all  ways, there  even is he,
and thee peoples for him at this day. He have follow the wake
of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav,
the Saxoon, the Magyar.
      "So far,  then, we have all we may act upon, and let me
tell you thaat very much of the beliefs are justified by what
we hhave seen in our own so unhappy experience.  The  vampire
live on, and ccannot die by mere passing of the time, he  can
flouriish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living.
Even more, we haave seen  amongst us that he  can  even  grow
younger,, that his vital faculties grow strenuous,and seem as

though they refresh themselves when his special  pabulum  is
plenty.
 
     "But he  cannot  flourish without this diet, he eat not
as others.   Even  friend  Jonathan,  who  lived with him for
weeeks, did never see him eat,  never!  He throws no  shadow,
he make in thhe mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe.
He haas the strength of many of his hand, witness again Jona-
than when he shhut the door against the wolves, and  when  he
help hiim from the diligence too. He can transform himself to
wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when  he
tear openn the dog, he can be as bat,as Madam Mina saw him on
tthe window  at  Whitby,  and as friend John saw him fly from
this so neaar house, and as my friend Quincey saw  him at the
winndow of Miss Lucy.
     "He can come in mist which he create, that noble ship's
captain pproved him of this, but, from what we know, the dis-
ttance  he  can make this mist is limited, and it can only be
round himseelf.
     "He  comme on moonlight rays as elemental dust, as again
Jonatthan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula.  He be-
come so  small,,  we  ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at
peace,  slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He
can,  when  once  he find his way, come out from anything or
into anytthing, no matter how close it be bound or even fused
uup with fire, solder you call it. He can see in the dark, no
small powerr this, in a world which is one half shut from the
ligght.  Ah, but hear me through.
      "He  can do all these things, yet he is not free.  Nay,
he is even  morre prisoner than the slave of the galley, than
the maddman in his cell.  He cannot go where he lists, he who
is not of nature  has yet to obey some of nature's laws, why
we know nnot.  He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless
tthere be some one  of  the  household  who bid him  to come,
though afteerwards he can come as he please.His power ceases,
as  does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day.
     "Only at ccertain times can he have limited freedom.  If
he be nnot  at the  place  whither  he is  bound, he can only
change  himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These
things wee are told, and in this record of ours we have proof
bby inference.  Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his
limit,when  he have his earth-home,his coffin-home, his hell-
homme, the place unhallowed, as we  saw  when  he went to the
grave of the  suicide at  Whitby, still at other time  he can
only  change when the time come. It is said, too, that he can
only pass  runnning  water at  the  slack or the flood of the
tide. TThen there are things which so afflict him that he has
no  power, as  the garlic that we know of, and as for things
sacred,ass this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even
nnow  when we  resolve, to them he  is  nothing, but in their
presence hee take  his place far off and silent with respect.
Theere are others,too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our
seeking we maay need them.
      "The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he
move not from  it, a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill
him soo  that he be true  dead, and  as for the stake through
him, we know alrready of its peace, or  the cut off head that
giveth rrest.  We have seen it with our eyes.
     "Thus when  we find the habitation of this man-that-was,
we can cconfine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey

what  we  know.  But  he  is clever.  I have asked my friend
Arminius,  of Buda-Pesth University, to make his  record, and
frrom all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been.
He must, inddeed, have been  that Voivode Dracula who won his
namee  against  the  Turk, over  the  great river on the very
frontier of Tuurkey-land.  If it be so, then was he no common
man, ffor in that time, and for centuries after,he was spoken
of as  the cleveerest and the most  cunning,  as  well as the
bravest   of  the sons of the `land beyond the forest.'  That

mighty brain and that iron  resolution  went with him to his
grave, andd are  even now arrayed  against us.  The  Draculas
weere, says Arminius, a  great and noble race, though now and
again were sscions who were held by their coevals to have had
deallings with the Evil One.  They learned his secrets in the
Scholomance,   amongst the mountains  over  Lake Hermanstadt,
where  the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due.  In the
records are  succh words as `stregoica'  witch,  `ordog'  and
`pokol'   Satan  and  hell, and  in  one manuscript this very

Dracula is spoken of as `wampyr,'which we all understand too
well.  Theere have been from the loins of this very one great
meen and good women, and  their  graves make sacred the earth
where alone  this foulness can dwell. For it is not the least
of   its  terrors that  this evil thing is rooted deep in all
good, in soil  barren of holy memories it cannot rest."
     Whilst  they were talking Mr.Morris was looking steadily
at tthe window, and he now got up quietly,and went out of the
room.  There wwas a little pause, and then the Professor went
on.
 
     "And now  we must settle what we do.  We have here much
data, and wwe must proceed  to lay out our campaign.  We know
froom the inquiry of Jonathan  that from the castle to Whitby
came fifty  bboxes  of  earth, all of which were delivered at
Carfaax, we also know that  at least some of these boxes have
been removed.   It seems to me, that our first step should be
to asceertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond
that wall where we look today, or whether any more have been
removed.   If the latter, we must trace . . ."
     Here we werre interrupted in a very startling way.  Out-
side thee house came the sound of a pistol shot, the glass of

the window  was  shattered with a bullet, which ricochetting
from the ttop of the  embrasure,  struck the  far wall of the
rooom.  I  am  afraid I  am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
out.  The meen all jumped to their  feet, Lord Godalming flew
overr to  the  window and threw up the sash.  As he did so we
heard  Mr. Morrris'  voice without,   "Sorry!  I fear  I have
alarmeed you.  I shall come in and tell you about it."
      A minute later he came in and said,  "It was an idiotic
thing of me to  do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker,  most
sincereely, I fear I must have  frightened you terribly.  But
the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came
a  big  bbat and  sat  on the window sill.  I have got such a
hhorror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot
stand them,, and  I  went  out to have a shot, as I have been
doiing of  late  of evenings,  whenever I have seen one.  You
used to laughh at me for it then, Art."
     "Didd you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.
     "I don't knnow,  I fancy not,  for it flew away into the
wood."   Without  saying  any more he  took his seat, and the

Professor began to resume his statement.
     "We musst  trace  each of these  boxes,  and when we are
readdy,  we must either capture or kill this monster  in  his
lair, or we muust, so  to speak, sterilize the earth, so that
no morre he can seek safety in it.Thus in the end we may find
him in his form  of man between the hours of noon and sunset,
and so eengage with him when he is at his most weak.
     "Andd now for you,Madam Mina,this night is the end until
aall be well.  You are  too precious to us to have such risk.
When we parrt tonight, you no  more must  question.  We shall
telll you all in good time.  We are men and are able to bear,
but you must  be our star and  our hope, and we shall act all
the mmore free that you are not in the danger,such as we are."
     All the mmen, even Jonathan, seemed relieved, but it did
not seeem to me good that they should brave  danger and, per-
haps lessen theiir safety,  strength  being the  best safety,
through  care of me, but their minds were made up, and though

it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing,
save to acccept their chivalrous care of me.
      Mr. Morris resumed the discussion, "As there is no time
to lose, I  vote we have a look at his house right now.  Time
is  everything with him,and swift action on our part may save
another victiim."
     I own thhat  my heart began to fail me when the time for
actioon came so close,  but I did not say anything, for I had
a greater fear  that if I  appeared  as a drag or a hindrance
to theiir work,they might even leave me out of their counsels
altogether.  They have now gone off to Carfax, with means to
get into  the house.
     MManlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep, as if
a woman can sleeep when those she loves are in danger!I shall
lie  dowwn,  and  pretend  to sleep, lest Jonathan have added

anxiety about me when he returns.


 DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

     1 Octobober, 4 a.m.--Just  as we were about  to leave the
housse, an  urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to
know if I  wouuld see him at once, as he had something of the
utmostt importance to say to me.  I told the messenger to say
that I would atttend to his wishes in the morning, I was busy
just at  the moment.
      The  attendant added,  "He seems very importunate, sir.
I have never seeen him so eager.I don't know but what, if you
don't ssee him soon, he will have one of his violent fits." I
knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so
I said,   "All right, I'll go now," and I asked the others to
wwait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my patient.
     "Takee me with you,friend John," said the Professor."His
caase in your diary interest me much, and it had bearing,too,
now and agaiin on our case.  I should much like to  see  him,
and  especial when his mind is disturbed."
     "May I comme also?" asked Lord Godalming.
      "Me too?"  said  Quincey Morris.   "May  I come?"  said
Harker.  I noddded, and we all went down the passage together.
      We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but
far more rationnal in his speech and manner than I  had  ever
seen hiim.  There was an unusual  understanding  of  himself,
which  was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic,
and he toook  it  for granted that his reasons  would prevail
wwith others entirely sane.  We all five  went into the room,
but none off the others at first said  anything.  His request
wass that I  would  at  once  release him from the asylum and
send him homee.This he backed up with arguments regarding his
compllete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity.
      "I appeal to your friends,"he said,"they will, perhaps,
not mind sittting in judgement on my case.  By  the  way, you
havee not introduced me."
     I was so  much astonished, that the oddness of introduc-
ing a   madman in  an asylum did not strike me at the moment,
and besides,therre was a certain dignity in the man's manner,
so much   of  the habit  of equality, that I at once made the

introduction,  "Lord Godalming,  Professor  Van Helsing, Mr.
Quincey Moorris,of Texas, Mr. Jonathan Harker, Mr. Renfield."
      He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn, "Lord
Godalming, II had the honor of seconding  your father at  the
Winddham, I grieve to know, by your  holding  the title, that
he is no more..  He was a man loved and  honored  by  all who
knew hhim, and in his youth was, I  have heard, the  inventor
of a burnt  rum   punch, much patronized on Derby night.  Mr.
Morris,  you should be proud of your great state.  Its recep-

tion  into  the  Union  was a  precedent which may have far-
reaching eeffects hereafter, when  the  Pole  and the Tropics
maay hold alliance to  the Stars and Stripes.  The  power  of
Treaty may yyet prove a vast  engine of enlargement, when the
Monrroe doctrine takes its true  place  as a political fable.
What  shall  aany man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Hel-
sing?   Sir,  I  make  no  apology  for dropping all forms of
conventional preefix.  When an individual  has revolutionized
therapeuutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of

brain matter, conventional  forms are unfitting, since  they
would seemm to limit him to one of a class.  You,  gentlemen,
whho  by  nationality, by  heredity, or by the possession  of
natural giftts, are fitted to hold your respective  places in
the  moving world, I take to witness  that I am as sane as at
least  the  maajority  of men  who  are in full possession of
their  liberties.  And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, human-
itarian and mediico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it
a  morall duty to deal with me as one to be considered as un-

der exceptional circumstances."He made this last appeal with
a courtly  air of conviction which  was  not without  its own
chharm.
     I thinkk  we were all staggered.  For my own part, I was
undeer  the  conviction,  despite  my knowledge  of the man's
character and  history, that his reason had been restored,and
I  fellt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satis-
fied  as  to  hiis  sanity, and would see about the necessary
formalitties for  his  release in  the morning.  I thought it

better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement,
for of oldd I knew the  sudden  changes  to which this parti-
cuular patient was liable.  So I contented myself with making
a general sttatement  that he  appeared  to be improving very
rapiidly, that  I  would  have a  longer chat with him in the
morning, and wwould then see what I could do in the direction
of meeeting his wishes.

     This  did  not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly,
"But I feaar, Dr. Seward,  that you hardly apprehend my wish.
I   desire to go at once,here, now, this very hour, this very
moment, if II may.  Time  presses, and in  our implied agree-
mentt with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the con-
tract.  I  am   sure  it  is  only necessary to put before so
admiraable a practitioner as Dr. Seward  so  simple,  yet  so
momentous a wishh, to ensure its fulfilment."
     HHe looked at me keenly, and seeing  the  negative in my
face, turned to  the others, and scrutinized them closely.Not
meeting  any sufficient response, he went on, "Is it possible

that I have erred in my supposition?"
     "You have,," I said frankly, but at the same time, as  I
felt, bbrutally.
     Theere was a considerable pause,and then he said slowly,

"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request.  Let
me  ask foor this concession, boon, privilege, what you will.
I  am  content  to  implore  in  such a case, not on personal
grounds, butt for the sake of others.  I am not at liberty to
givee you the whole of my reasons, but you may, I assure you,
take it from mme that they are good ones,sound and unselfish,
and sppring from the highest sense of duty.
     "Could you  look,  sir, into my heart, you would approve
to the ffull the sentiments which animate me.  Nay, more, you

would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends."
     Againn he looked at us all keenly.  I had a growing con-
viiction  that this  sudden change of his entire intellectual
method was   but  yet another  phase of  his  madness, and so
deteermined to let him  go  on a little longer, knowing  from
experience thaat  he  would,  like all lunatics, give himself
away iin the end.  Van Helsing was gazing  at him with a look
of utmost intenssity, his bushy eyebrows  almost meeting with
the fixeed concentration of his look.  He said to Renfield in

a tone  which did not surprise me at the time, but only when
I thought   of it afterwards, for it was as of one addressing
ann equal,  "Can  you not tell frankly  your  real reason for
wishing to bbe free  tonight?  I  will undertake  that if you
willl satisfy even me, a  stranger,  without  prejudice,  and
with the habitt of keeping an  open mind,Dr. Seward will give
you, aat his own  risk  and  on  his  own responsibility, the
privilege you seeek."
     He  shoook  his head sadly,  and with a look of poignant
regrret on his face.  The  Professor  went  on,  "Come,  sir,
bethink yourseelf.  You claim the  privilege of reason in the
highesst degree, since you seek to impress  us with your com-
plete  reasonablleness.  You  do  this, whose  sanity we have
reason tto doubt,since you are not yet released  from medical

treatment for this very defect.  If you  will not help us in
our effortt to choose  the wisest course, how  can we perform
thhe duty which you yourself put upon  us?  Be wise, and help
us, and if wwe can we shall aid you to achieve your wish."
     Hee still shook his head as he  said,  "Dr. Van Helsing,
I have nothing to say.  Your argument  is complete, and if I
were freee to speak I should not hesitate  a moment, but I am
nnot my own master in the matter.I can only  ask you to trust
me.  If I aam refused, the responsibility does  not rest with
me.."
     I  thoughtt  it was now time to end the scene, which was
becominng  too  comically  grave, so I went towards the door,
simply  saying,  "Come,  my  friends,  we  have  work to do.
Goodnightt."
     As,  howeever, I  got  near the  door, a new change came
over tthe patient.  He moved towards me  so quickly  that for
the moment I feaared that he was about to make another  homi-
cidal atttack.  My fears, however, were  groundless,  for  he

held up his two hands imploringly, and made  his petition in
a  moving   manner.  As he  saw  that the  very excess of his
emmotion was militating  against him,  by restoring  us  more
to our old rrelations, he became still more demonstrative.  I
glannced at Van Helsing, and saw my  conviction reflected  in
his eyes, so II became a little more fixed  in my  manner, if
not moore stern, and motioned to  him that his  efforts  were
unavailing. I haad previously seen something of the same con-
stantly  growing excitement in him when  he had to  make some

request of which at the time he had thought  much, such  for
instance,  as when he wanted a cat, and I was prepared to see
thhe  collapse into the  same  sullen  acquiescence  on  this
occasion.
 
     My expectation was not realized, for when he found that
his appeal  would not be successful,he got into quite a fran-
ticc condition.He threw himself on his knees, and held up his
hands, wringiing them  in  plaintive supplication, and poured
forthh a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his
cheeks,and his  whole face and form expressive of the deepest
emotionn.
      "Let me eentreat you, Dr.Seward, oh, let me implore you,
to lett me  out of  this house at once.  Send me away how you
will and where yyou will, send keepers with me with whips and
chains,  let them take me in a strait waistcoat, manacled and

leg-ironed,even to gaol, but let me go out of this.You don't
know what  you do by keeping me here.  I am speaking from the
deepths of my heart, of my very soul. You don't know whom you
wrong, or hoow, and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
By  all  you  hold sacred, by all you hold dear, by your love
that is lost,,  by your  hope that lives, for the sake of the
Almigghty, take me out of this  and  save my soul from guilt!
Can't you hear  me, man? Can't you understand? Will you never
learn?  Don't you know that I am sane and earnest now, that I
am no lunatic  in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his
soul?  Ohh, hear me!  Hear  me!  Let me go, let me go, let me
ggo!"
     I  thougght  that  the longer this went on the wilder he
wouldd get, and so would bring on a fit, so I took him by the
hand and raisedd him up.
     "Coome,"  I said  sternly, "no more of this, we have had

quite enough already. Get to your bed and try to behave more
discreetlyy."
     He  suddeenly stopped and looked at me intently for sev-
eral mmoments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over,
sat down on the  side of  the bed.  The collapse had come, as
on formeer occasions, just as I had expected.
     When I was  leaving the room, last of our party, he said
to me  iin a quiet, well-bred voice,  "You will, I trust, Dr.

Seward, do me the justice  to bear in mind, later on, that I
did what II could to convince you tonight."



CHAPTER 19

  
               JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

     1 Octobober, 5 a.m.--I went with  the party to the search
withh an easy mind,for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely
strong and  weell.  I am so  glad that she consented  to hold
back aand let us men do the work.  Somehow, it was a dread to
me that she was   in  this fearful business at all,  but  now
that herr work is done, and that  it is due to her energy and

brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in
such a wayy that  every  point tells,  she may well feel that
heer part is finished, and  that she can henceforth leave the
rest  to us..  We  were, I think,  all  a little upset by the
scenne with Mr. Renfield.  When we came away from his room we
were silent tiill we got back to the study.
     TThen Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward, "Say, Jack, if that
man wasn't attemmpting a bluff,he is about the sanest lunatic
I ever ssaw.  I'm not sure,  but I believe that he  had  some

serious purpose, and if he had, it was  pretty rough  on him
not to gett a chance."
      Lord Godalming  and I  were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing
added,  "Friendd John, you know  more lunatics than I do, and
I'm glaad of  it, for I fear that if it had been to me to de-
cide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given
him free..  But we live and learn, and in our present task we
mmust take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.  All is
best as theey are."
     Dr.  Seward  seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind
oof way,  "I don't know but that  I agree  with you.  If that
man  had beeen  an  ordinary  lunatic  I  would have taken my
chaance  of  trusting  him, but he seems so mixed up with the
Count in an iindexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing any-
thinng wrong by helping his fads.I can't forget how he prayed
with almost eqqual fervor for a cat,and then tried to tear my
throatt out with his teeth.Besides, he called the Count `lord
and master',  annd he may want to get out to help him in some
diaboliccal way.That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats

and  his  own kind to  help him, so I suppose he isn't above
trying to  use a  respectable lunatic.  He certainly did seem
eaarnest,  though.  I  only  hope  we have done what is best.
These thingss,  in conjunction  with the wild work we have in
handd, help to unnerve a man."
     The  Professor stepped over,  and laying his hand on his
sshoulder, said in his grave, kindly way,  "Friend John, have
no  fear.   We  are  trying to do  our duty in a very sad and
terrrible case, we can  only  do as  we deem best.  What else
have we to hoope for, except the pity of the good God?"
     Lord GGodalming had  slipped away for a few minutes, but
noww he returned.  He held up  a little silver whistle, as he
remarked,  "TThat old place may  be  full of rats, and if so,
I've  got an antidote on call."
     Haviing  passed the wall, we  took our way to the house,
ttaking care to keep in the shadows of  the trees on the lawn
when the mooonlight shone  out.  When we got to the porch the
Proofessor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which
he  laid  on  the step, sorting them into four little groups,
evideently one for each.  Then he spoke.

     "My friends,we are going into a terrible danger, and we
need arms  of many kinds.  Our enemy is not merely spiritual.
Reemember that  he has  the strength of twenty men, and that,
though our nnecks or our windpipes are of the common kind,and
therrefore  breakable  or  crushable, his are not amenable to
mere strength..  A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
in alll than him, can at certain times hold him, but they can-
not hurt  him aas we can be hurt by him.  We must, therefore,
guard oourselves from his touch.  Keep this near your heart."
As he  spoke  he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it
out to mee,  I being nearest to him, "put these flowers round
yyour neck," here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic
blossoms, ""for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and
thiis knife,and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps,
which you caan fasten  to your breast, and for all, and above
all  at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless."
     This  waas a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an
envellope and handed to me.  Each of the others was similarly
equipped.
       "Now,"he said,"friend John, where are the skeleton keys?
If so that wee can open  the door, we need not break house by
the wwindow, as before at Miss Lucy's."
      Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechani-
cal dexteriity as a surgeon standing him in good stead.  Pre-
senntly  he  got  one  to  suit, after a little play back and
forward the bbolt yielded, and with a rusty clang, shot back.
We prressed  on  the  door, the  rusty hinges creaked, and it
slowly opened.  It was startlingly like the image conveyed to
me  in  Dr. Seward's  diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's
tomb, I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others,
for withh one accord they shrank back.  The Professor was the

first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.
     "In manus ttuas, Domine!"he said, crossing himself as he
passed oover the threshold.We closed the door behind us, lest

when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract
attention  from the road.  The  Professor carefully tried the
loock,  lest  we  might  not  be  able to open it from within
should we bee in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our
lampps and proceeded on our search.
      The light  from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd
forms, as the  rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our
bodiess threw great shadows. I could not for my life get away
from the feelingg that there was someone else amongst  us.  I
suppose  it was the recollection, so powerfully brought  home

to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible  experience
in Transyllvania.  I think the feeling was common to  us all,
foor  I  noticed that  the others  kept  looking  over  their
shoulders att every sound and every new shadow,just as I felt
myseelf doing.
     Thhe whole place was thick with dust.The floor was seem-
ingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps,
in  whichh  on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hob-
nnails where the dust was cracked.  The walls were fluffy and
heavy with  dust, and in the corners were masses of  spider's
webbs,whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
tattered ragss as the weight had torn them partly down.  On a
tablee in the hall was a great bunch  of  keys,  with a time-
yellowed label  on each.They had been used several times, for
on the  table were several similar  rents  in  the blanket of
dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them.
     He  turned to me and said,"You know this place, Jonathan.
You have  copied maps of it, and you know it at  least  more
than we ddo.  Which is the way to the chapel?"
     I  had an   idea  of  its direction, though on my former
visit I  had not been able to  get  admission to it, so I led

the way,and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite
a low, arcched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
     "This iss the spot," said the Professor as he turned his
lamp  on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my
original  correespondence  regarding  the  purchase.  With  a
little  trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened  the
door.  We were prepared for some  unpleasantness, for  as we
were openning  the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to ex-
hhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected  such an
odor  as  wwe  encountered.  None  of the  others had met the
Couunt at all at close quarters,  and when I  had seen him he
was  either   in the  fasting  stage  of his existence in his
roomss or,  when he was bloated with fresh blood, in a ruined
building open   to  the air, but here the place was small and
close,aand the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul.
There was an earrthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came
through  the fouler air. But as to the odor itself, how shall

I describe it?  It was not alone that it was composed of all
the ills oof mortality and with the pungent, acrid  smell  of
bllood, but it seemed as though corruption had become  itself
corrupt.  Faaugh!  It sickens me to think of it. Every breath
exhaaled by that monster seemed to have  clung to  the  place
and intensifieed its loathsomeness.
     Under  orrdinary  circumstances such a stench would have
broughht our enterprise  to  an end, but this was no ordinary
case, and the hiigh and terrible purpose in which we were in-
volved ggave us a strength which rose  above merely  physical

considerations.  After the involuntary shrinking  consequent
on the firrst nauseous whiff, we  one  and all set about  our
woork as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.
     We made  an accurate examination  of the place, the Pro-
fessoor saying as we began,  "The first thing is  to see  how
many of the boxxes are left, we must then examine every  hole
and corrner and cranny and see if we cannot get some  clue as
to what has become of the rest."
      A glance  was sufficient to show how many remained, for
the great eearth chests were bulky,and there was no mistaking
theem.
     There werre only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once
I got  a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and
look out of the  vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I
looked ttoo, and for an instant my heart stood  still.  Some-

where, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high
lights of  the Count's evil face, the ridge of  the nose, the
reed eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor.  It was only for a
moment, for,, as Lord Godalming said,"I thought I saw a face,
but  it was only the shadows,"  and  resumed  his  inquiry, I
turned my lampp in the direction,and stepped into the passage.
Theree was no sign of anyone,and as there were no corners, no
doors, no apertture of any  kind, but only the solid walls of
the passsage, there could be no hiding place even for him.  I
took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.
     A  feew  minutes  later  I saw Morris step suddenly back
frrom a corner,  which he was examining.  We all followed his
movements wiith our eyes,for undoubtedly some nervousness was
growwing  on  us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence,
which  twinkleed like stars.  We all instinctively drew back.
The whhole place was becoming alive with rats.
     For  a   moment or  two we stood appalled, all save Lord
Godallming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency.
Rushing  over   to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr.
Seward  had described  from the outside, and which I had seen
myself, he turned the key  in the lock, drew the huge bolts,
and swungg the door  open.  Then,  taking his  little  silver
wwhistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call.  It was
answered  ffrom  behind  Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of
doggs, and after about a minute  three  terriers came dashing
round the corrner  of  the  house.  Unconsciously  we had all
movedd towards the door, and as we moved  I  noticed that the
dust had been mmuch disturbed. The boxes which had been taken
out hadd been brought this way.  But  even in the minute that
had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased.They
seemed  tto  swarm over the place all at once, till the lamp-
llight, shining  on  their moving dark bodies and glittering,
baleful eyees, made  the  place look like a bank of earth set
witth fireflies.  The  dogs  dashed  on, but at the threshold
suddenly stoppped and snarled,and then,simultaneously lifting
theirr noses, began to howl in  most lugubrious fashion.  The
rats were multiiplying in thousands, and we moved out.
     Lord Godaalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him
in, pllaced him on the floor.The instant his feet touched the
ground  he  seemmed to recover his courage, and rushed at his
natural  enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he

had shaken the life  out of a score, the other dogs, who had
by now beeen lifted in  the  same  manner, had but small prey
erre the whole mass had vanished.
      With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had
departed, for   the  dogs frisked about and barked merrily as
they   made sudden darts at  their prostrate foes, and turned
them over and ovver  and  tossed them in the air with vicious
shakes.   We all seemed to find our spirits rise.  Whether it

was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
the chapell  door,  or  the  relief  which we  experienced by
fiinding ourselves in the open I know not, but most certainly
the shadow oof dread seemed to slip from us like  a robe, and
the  occasion of our coming lost something of its grim signi-
ficance, thouggh we did not slacken a whit in our resolution.
We cloosed the outer door and barred and locked it,and bring-
ing the dogs witth us, began our  search of  the  house.   We
found noothing throughout  except dust  in extraordinary pro-

portions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I
had  made   my first  visit.  Never once did the dogs exhibit
anny symptom of uneasiness, and  even when we returned to the
chapel  theyy  frisked  about as though  they had been rabbit
huntting in a summer wood.
     The mornning was  quickening in the east when we emerged
from  the front.  Dr. Van Helsing  had  taken the key  of the
hall door from  the bunch, and  locked the  door in  orthodox
fashionn, putting the key into his pocket when he had done.
      "So far,"  he said,  "our night has been eminently suc-
cessful.  NNo harm  has  come to us such as I feared might be
andd yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More
than all do II rejoice that this, our first, and perhaps  our
most   difficult  and  dangerous, step  has been accomplished
without the briinging thereinto our  most sweet Madam Mina or
troubliing her  waking or  sleeping  thoughts with sights and
sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget.One
lesson, ttoo, we have learned, if it be allowable to  argue a
pparticulari, that the brute beasts which are  to the Count's
command  arre  yet themselves  not  amenable to his spiritual
powwer, for look,these rats that would come to his call, just
as from his ccastle top he summon the wolves  to  your  going
and tto that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they
run pell-mell ffrom the so little dogs of my friend Arthur.We
have otther matters before us, other dangers,other fears, and
that monster . . .  He has not used his power over the brute
world forr the only or the  last time tonight.  So be it that
hhe has gone elsewhere. Good!  It has given us opportunity to
cry `check''in some ways in this chess game,which we play for
thee stake of human souls.  And now let us go home.  The dawn
is close at hhand, and  we have reason to be content with our
firstt  night's  work.  It may be  ordained that we have many
nights and dayss to follow, if full of  peril, but we must go
on, andd from no danger shall we shrink."
      The  house was  silent when  we got back, save for some
poor creatuure  who  was screaming away in one of the distant
warrds, and a low, moaning  sound  from Renfield's room.  The
poor wretch wwas doubtless torturing himself,after the manner
of thhe insane, with needless thoughts of pain.
     I camee tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep,
breeathing so  softly that  I had  to put my ear down to hear
it.  She lookks paler than usual.  I hope the meeting tonight
has nnot upset  her.  I  am  truly thankful that she is to be
left  out of ouur future work, and even of our deliberations.
It is ttoo great a strain for a woman to bear.I did not think
so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that
it is setttled.  There may be things which would frighten her
tto  hear,  and yet  to  conceal them from her might be worse
than to telll her if once  she  suspected  that there was any
conncealment.  Henceforth our work is  to be a sealed book to
her, till at  least such time as we  can tell her that all is
finisshed,  and  the earth free from  a monster of the nether
world.  I daressay it will be difficult to begin to keep sil-
ence affter  such confidence as ours, but I must be resolute,
and tomorrow I shall keep  dark over tonight's  doings,  and
shall reffuse to speak of anything that has happened.  I rest
oon the sofa, so as not to disturb her.

     1 Octobeber, later.--I suppose  it  was  natural  that we
shoulld have all overslept ourselves, for the day  was a busy
one, and the niight had no rest at all.  Even Mina must  have
felt itts exhaustion,for though I slept till the sun was high,
I was awake  beffore  her, and had to call two or three times
before sshe awoke.  Indeed, she  was so sound asleep that for

a  few  seconds she  did not  recognize me, but looked at me
with a sorrt of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked
ouut of a bad dream.  She complained a little of being tired,
and  I  let   her rest till later in the day.  We now know of
twennty-one boxes having  been  removed,  and if  it  be that
several were ttaken in any of these removals we may  be  able
to traace them all.  Such will, of course, immensely simplify
our labor, and tthe sooner  the matter  is  attended  to  the
better.   I shall look up Thomas Snelling today.

DR. SEWARD'D'S DIARY

     1 1 October.--It  was towards noon when I was awakened by
the Professor walking  into  my room.  He was more jolly and
cheerful   than  usual, and  it  is  quite  evident that last
nnight's work has helped to take some of the  brooding weight
off his minnd.
     After goiing over the adventure of the night he suddenly
said,   "Your patient interests me much.  May it be that with
you I visit him  this morning? Or if that you are too occupy,
I can goo alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to

find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound."
     I had soome work to do which pressed, so I told him that
if hee would go alone I  would  be glad, as then I should not
have to keep hiim waiting, so  I called an attendant and gave
him thee necessary  instructions.  Before  the Professor left
the room  I cautioned him against getting any false impress-
ion from  my patient.
      "But,"  he answered, "I want him to talk of himself and
of his  delusioon  as  to  consuming live things.  He said to
Madam MMina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had
once had such a belief.  Why do you smile, friend John?"
     "Excuse  me," I said,  "but the answer is here."  I laid
my haand on the typewritten matter."When our sane and learned
lunatic made thhat very statement of how he used  to  consume
life,   his  mouth  was actually nauseous with the flies  and
spiders which he had eaten just before  Mrs. Harker  entered
the room.."
     Van Helsinng  smiled  in  turn.  "Good!" he said.  "Your
memory  is true, friend John.  I should have remembered.  And
yet  it  is  this very obliquity of thought and memory which
makes menntal disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may
ggain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman  than  I
shall from  the teaching of the most wise.  Who knows?"
     I weent on with my work,and before long was through that
iin hand.  It seemed that the time had been very short indeed,
but there  was Van Helsing back in the study.

     "Do I interrupt?"  he asked politely as he stood at the
door.
       "Not at all,"I answered. "Come in. My work is finished,
and I am freee.  I can go with you now, if you like."
     "It is nneedless, I have seen him!"
     "Weell?"
     "I fearr that he does not appraise me at much.Our inter-
vieww was  short.  When I entered his room he was  sitting on
a stool in  thhe center,with his elbows on his knees, and his
face wwas the  picture of  sullen discontent.  I spoke to him
as cheerfully ass I could, and with such a measure of respect
as I couuld assume.  He  made  no reply whatever.  'Don't you

know me?' I asked.  His answer was  not reassuring.  "I know
you well eenough, you are the  old fool  Van Helsing.  I wish
yoou  would  take yourself  and your  idiotic  brain theories
somewhere  eelse.  Damn  all  thick-headed  Dutchmen!'  Not a
wordd more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness
as indifferentt to  me  as  though I had not been in the room
at alll. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learn-
ing  from  this   so clever lunatic, so I shall go, if I may,
and cheeer  myself  with  a  few  happy words with that sweet

soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable
that she iis  no  more  to  be pained, no  more to be worried
wiith our terrible things.  Though  we  shall  much  miss her
help, it is  better so."
      "I agree with you  with all my heart," I answered ear-
nestly,   for  II did not want him to weaken in this matter.
"Mrs. Harrker  is  better out of  it.  Things  are quite bad
ennough for us, all men of the  world, and  who have been in
many tight pllaces  in  our  time, but it  is no place for a
woman,,  and  if she had remained in  touch with the affair,
it would in time infallibly have wrecked her."
      So  Van Helsing  has  gone to  confer with Mrs. Harker
and Harker,  Quiincey and  Art are all  out following up the
clues as  to the  earth  boxes.  I shall  finish my round of
woork and we shall meet tonight.

           MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

       1 October.--It is  strange to me to be kept in the dark
as I am today,  after  Jonathan's full confidence for so many
years,tto see him manifestly avoid certain matters, and those
the  most vital of all.  This morning I slept late after the
fatigues   of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he
wwas  the earlier.  He  spoke to me before he went out, never
more sweetlly or tenderly,  but  he never mentioned a word of
whaat had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet
he must have  known how terribly anxious  I  was.  Poor  dear
felloow! I suppose it must have distressed him even more than
it did me.  Theey all agreed that it was best that  I  should
not be  drawn further into this awful work, and I acquiesced.
But to think that he keeps anything from me!  And  now  I am
crying  llike a silly fool, when I know it comes from my hus-
bband's great love and from the good,  good wishes  of  those
other stronng men.
     That   has  done  me good.  Well, some day Jonathan will
teell me all.  And  lest  it  should  ever  be that he should
think for a  moment that I kept anything  from  him,  I still
keepp my journal as usual.  Then if he has feared of my trust
I shall show iit to him, with every thought of  my  heart put
down ffor his dear eyes to  read.  I feel  strangely sad  and
low-spirited todday.  I  suppose  it is the reaction from the
terriblee excitement.
      Last night  I went to bed when the men had gone, simply
because they ttold  me  to.  I didn't feel  sleepy, and I did
feel ffull of devouring anxiety.  I kept thinking over every-
thing that has   been  ever  since Jonathan came to see me in
London,  and it all  seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate

pressing on relentlessly  to  some destined end.  Everything
that one ddoes seems, no  matter how right it me be, to bring
onn the very thing which is most to be deplored.  If I hadn't
gone to Whittby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now.
She  hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and
if  she  hadn''t  come  there  in  the  day  time with me she
wouldnn't  have walked in  her sleep.  And if she hadn't gone
there  at night   and asleep, that monster couldn't have des-
troyed hher as he did. Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There

now, crying again!  I wonder what has come over me today.  I
must hide  it  from Jonathan, for  if he knew that I had been
crrying twice in  one morning . . .  I, who never cried on my
own account,,and whom he has never caused to shed a tear, the
dearr fellow would fret his heart out.I shall put a bold face
on, and if I ddo feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose
it is   just  one  of the  lessons that we poor women have to
learn . . .
       I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night.  I
remember hearring the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of
queerr  sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from
Mr. Renfield's  room, which is somewhere under this. And then
there wwas silence over everything, silence  so profound that
it startled me,and I got up and looked out of the window.All
was  darkk  and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moon-
llight seeming full of a silent mystery of their  own.  Not a
thing seemeed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as
deaath or fate,so that a thin streak of white mist,that crept
with almost iimperceptible slowness across  the grass towards
the hhouse, seemed to have a sentience and a  vitality of its
own.  I think tthat the digression of my  thoughts  must have
done mee good, for when I got back to bed I  found a lethargy
creeping over me.  I lay a while, but could not quite sleep,
so I got  out and looked out of the  window  again.  The mist
wwas spreading, and was now close up to  the house, so that I
could see iit lying thick against the wall, as though it were
steealing up to the windows.  The poor man was more loud than
ever, and thoough I could not distinguish a  word  he said, I
couldd in some way recognize in his tones some passionate en-
treaty on his ppart. Then there was  the sound of a struggle,
and I kknew that the attendants were dealing with him.  I was
so frightened that I crept into bed,  and pulled the clothes
over my hhead, putting my fingers in my ears.  I was not then
aa bit sleepy, at least so I thought, but  I must have fallen
asleep, forr except dreams, I do not remember  anything until
thee morning, when Jonathan woke me. I  think that it took me
an effort andd a little time to realize where I was, and that
it waas Jonathan who was bending over me.  My dream  was very
peculiar,  and  was  almost  typical of  the way that  waking
thoughtts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.
     I tthought that I was asleep,and waiting for Jonathan to

come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless
to act, myy feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted,so
thhat nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I slept
uneasily andd thought. Then it began to dawn upon me that the
air  was heavy, and dank, and cold.  I put back  the  clothes
from my face,  and found, to my surprise,  that all  was  dim
aroundd.  The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but
turned down, camme only like a tiny red spark through the fog,
which hhad evidently grown thicker and poured into  the room.
Then it occurred to me that I had shut the   window before I
had come  to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the
ppoint, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and
even my willl.I lay still and endured, that was all. I closed
my  eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is won-
derful what ttricks our dreams play us, and  how conveniently
we caan imagine.)  The mist grew thicker  and  thicker  and I
could see now hhow it came in, for I could see it like smoke,
or withh the white energy of boiling water, pouring  in,  not
through the window, but through the joinings of the door. It
got thickker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became con-
ccentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room,through
the top of  which I could see the light of  the  gas  shining
likke a red eye.  Things began to whirl through my brain just
as  the  clouudy column was  now whirling in  the  room,  and
throuugh it all came the scriptural words  "a pillar of cloud
by day and of ffire by night."  Was it  indeed such spiritual
guidancce that was coming to me in my sleep?  But  the pillar
was composed of both the day and the night guiding, for  the
fire was  in the red eye, which at the thought gat a new fas-
ccination for me, till, as I looked,  the  fire  divided, and
seemed to sshine on me through the fog like two red eyes,such
as  Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when,on
the cliff,thee dying sunlight struck the windows of St.Mary's
Churcch.  Suddenly the horror burst upon me  that it was thus
that  Jonathan  had seen those awful women growing into real-
ity thrrough the whirling mist in the moonlight,  and  in  my
dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness.The
last consscious effort which imagination  made was to show me
aa livid white face bending over me out of the mist.
      I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat
one's reasonn  if  there were too much  of them.  I would get
Dr.  Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something  for me
which would maake me sleep, only that I fear  to  alarm them.
Such aa dream  at the  present  time would  become woven into
their  fears forr me.  Tonight I shall  strive  hard to sleep
naturallly.  If I do not, I shall tomorrow night get them  to

give me a dose of chloral, that cannot hurt me for once, and
it will giive me a good  night's  sleep.  Last night tired me
moore than if I had not slept at all.


     2 October 110 p.m.--Last  night  I  slept,  but  did not
dream.   I must have slept  soundly, for I was not  waked  by

Jonathan coming to bed, but the sleep  has not refreshed me,
for today  I feel terribly  weak and spiritless. I  spent all
yeesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.In the after-
noon, Mr. Reenfield asked if he might see me.Poor man, he was
veryy gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade
God bless me.   Some way it affected me much.I am crying when
I thinnk of him.  This is a new weakness, of which  I must be
careful.  Jonathhan would be miserable if he knew  I had been
crying.  He and the others were out till dinner time,and they

all came in tired.  I did what I could to  brighten them up,
and I supppose that the effort did me  good, for I forgot how
tiired I was.  After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went
off to smokee together, as they said, but  I  knew  that they
wantted to tell each  other of  what  had  occurred  to  each
during the dayy.  I could see from Jonathan's  manner that he
had soomething important to communicate.  I was not so sleepy
as I should havee been, so before they went I asked Dr.Seward
to give  me a little opiate of some kind,  as I had not slept

well the night before.  He very kindly made me up a sleeping
draught, wwhich he gave to me, telling me that it would do me
noo harm, as it was very mild . . .  I have  taken it, and am
waiting for  sleep, which still keeps aloof.I hope I have not
donee wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
comes, that I  may have been foolish in thus depriving myself
of thee power of waking.  I might want it.  Here comes sleep.
Goodnight.




CHAPTER 20

          JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

       1 October, evening.--I found  Thomas  Snelling  in  his
house at Bethhnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condi-
tion  to remember anything.  The very prospect of beer  which
my expected comming had opened to him had proved too much,and
he had  begun too early on his expected debauch.  I  learned,
however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that
he was onnly the assistant of Smollet, who  of the two  mates
wwas the responsible person.  So off I drove to Walworth, and
found Mr. JJoseph Smollet at home  and in  his  shirtsleeves,
takking  a late tea out of a saucer.  He is a decent, intell-
igent fellow,, distinctly a good, reliable type  of  workman,
and wwith a headpiece of his own. He remembered all about the
incident of thee boxes, and from a  wonderful dog-eared note-
book,whhich he produced from some mysterious receptacle about
the seat  of  his  trousers, and  which  had  hieroglyphical
entries iin thick, half-obliterated  pencil, he  gave  me the
ddestinations of the boxes.  There were,  he said, six in the
cartload whhich he took from Carfax and left at 197 Chicksand
Strreet, Mile End New Town,and another six which he deposited
at Jamaica Laane, Bermondsey.  If  then  the  Count meant  to
scattter  these  ghastly  refuges of  his over London,  these
places were choosen as the first of delivery,so that later he
might ddistribute more fully.  The systematic manner in which
this was  done  made me think that he could not mean to con-
fine himsself to two sides of London. He was now fixed on the
ffar east on the northern shore,  on the east of the southern
shore, and  on the south.The north and west were surely never
meaant to be left out of his diabolical scheme, let alone the
City itself aand the very heart  of fashionable London in the
southh-west and west.I went back to Smollet, and asked him if
he  could  telll  us  if  any other boxes had been taken from
Carfax..
     He  repliedd,  "Well  guv'nor,  you've  treated  me very
'an'somee", I had given him half a sovereign, "an  I'll  tell

yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four
nights agoo in the  'Are  an'  'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley, as
'oow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare  dusty job in a old 'ouse
at Purfleet..  There ain't a many such jobs as this 'ere, an'
I'm  thinkin' that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut."
     I asked if he could tell me  where to find him.  I told
him that   if he could  get  me the address it would be worth
aanother half sovereign to him.  So he  gulped down  the rest
of his tea  and stood up, saying that he  was  going to begin
thee search then and there.
     At thee door he stopped, and said,  "Look 'ere, guv'nor,
theere ain't no sense  in  me a keepin' you 'ere.  I may find
Sam soon, or  I mayn't,  but  anyhow he ain't like to be in a
way tto tell ye much tonight.Sam is a rare one when he starts
on the booze.   If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on
it, andd put yer address on it, I'll find out where Sam is to
be found and post it ye tonight. But ye'd better be up arter
'im  soonn  in  the  mornin',  never mind the booze the night
aafore."
     This  was all practical, so one of the children went off
wiith a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to
keep the chaange.When she came back, I addressed the envelope
and  stamped  it,  and when Smollet had again faithfully pro-
mised to post  the address when found, I took my way to home.
We're  on the track anyhow. I am tired tonight, and I want to
sleep. Mina is ffast asleep, and looks a little too pale. Her
eyes loook as though she had been crying.  Poor dear, I've no

doubt  it  frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make
her doublyy anxious about me and the others.  But it  is best
ass it is.It is better to be disappointed and worried in such
a way now thhan to have her nerve broken.  The  doctors  were
quitte right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
business.  I mmust be firm, for on me  this particular burden
of sillence must rest.  I shall not ever enter on the subject
with her under aany circumstances.Indeed,It may not be a hard
task, affter all, for she herself has  become reticent on the

subject, and has not spoken  of the Count or his doings ever
since we ttold her of our decision.

     2 O October, evening--A long and trying and exciting day.

By the first post I got my directed envelope  with  a  dirty
scrap of ppaper enclosed, on which was written with a carpen-
teer's pencil in a sprawling hand,  "Sam Bloxam, Korkrans,  4
Poters Cort,, Bartel Street, Walworth.  Arsk for the depite."
      I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking  Mina.
She looked heaavy and sleepy and pale, and far from  well.  I
determmined not to wake  her, but that when  I  should return
from this new seearch, I would  arrange for her going back to
Exeter.   I think she would be happier in  our own home, with

her daily tasks to interest her, than in being  here amongst
us and in  ignorance.  I only  saw Dr. Seward  for a  moment,
annd told him where I was off to, promising  to come back and
tell the resst so soon as I should have found out anything. I
drovve  to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter's
Court.  Mr. Smmollet's  spelling  misled  me, as  I asked for
Poter''s Court instead of  Potter's  Court.  However,  when I
had found the coourt, I had no difficulty in discovering Cor-
coran's  lodging house.
      When  I  asked  the man  who  came  to the door for the
"depite," hee shook his head, and said,  "I dunno 'im.  There
ain''t no such a person 'ere.  I never 'eard of 'im in all my
bloomin' days.. Don't believe there ain't nobody of that kind
livin'' 'ere or anywheres."
     I took ouut Smollet's letter, and as I read it it seemed
to me  that  the  lesson  of  the spelling of the name of the
court might guidde me.  "What are you?" I asked.
      "I'm the depity," he answered.
      I saw at once that  I was on the right track.  Phonetic
spelling  haad  again  misled  me.  A  half crown tip put the
depuuty's knowledge  at  my  disposal, and I learned that Mr.
Bloxam, who haad slept off  the  remains of his beer  on  the
previoous night at Corcoran's,had left for his work at Poplar
at five o'clock  that morning. He could not tell me where the
place off work was situated, but he had a vague idea  that it

was  some  kind  of  a  "new-fangled ware'us," and with this
slender cllue I had to start for Poplar.It was twelve o'clock
beefore I got any satisfactory  hint  of such a building, and
this I got aat a coffee shop, where some workmen were  having
theiir dinner.  One of them suggested that  there  was  being
erected at Crooss Angel Street a new "cold storage" building,
and ass this suited the condition of a "new-fangled ware'us,"
I at once drove  to it.  An interview with a surly gatekeeper
and a suurlier foreman, both of  whom  were appeased with the

coin of the realm, put me on the  track  of  Bloxam.  He was
sent for oon my suggestion that I was willing to pay his days
waages to his foreman for the privilege of asking  him  a few
questions onn a private matter.  He was a smart enough fellow,
thoough rough of speech and bearing.  When  I had promised to
pay for his iinformation and given him an earnest, he told me
that  he had made two journeys between Carfax  and a house in
Piccadilly, andd had taken from this house to the latter nine
great bboxes, "main heavy ones," with a  horse and cart hired
by him for this purpose.
      I   asked  him  if  he  could tell me the number of the
hhouse in Piccadilly, to which  he replied, "Well, guv'nor, I
forgits  thhe  number, but  it was only a few door from a big
whiite church, or  somethink of the kind, not long built.  It
was a dusty oold  'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness
of thhe 'ouse we tooked the bloomin' boxes from."
     "Howw did you get in if both houses were empty?"
     "Theere  was  the old party what engaged me a waitin' in
tthe 'ouse at Purfleet.  He  'elped  me to lift the boxes and
put them inn the dray.  Curse me,  but  he was  the strongest
chaap I ever struck, an' him a old feller, with a white mous-
tache, one thhat thin you would  think  he couldn't  throw  a
shaddder."
     How thiis phrase thrilled through me!
      "Why,  'e  took  up  'is end o' the boxes like they was
pounds of tea,  and me a puffin'  an' a blowin' afore I could
upend mmine anyhow, an' I'm no chicken, neither."
     "How ddid you get into the house in Piccadilly?" I asked.
      "He was there too. He must 'a started off and got there
afore me, foor when I rung of  the bell he kem an' opened the
doorr 'isself an' 'elped me carry the boxes into the 'all."
     "The whole  nine?" I asked.
      "Yus,  there was five in the first load an' four in the
second.  Itt was  main dry work, an' I don't so well remember
'oww I got 'ome."
      I interrupted him,  "Were the boxes  left in the hall?"
     "Yus, itt was a big 'all, an'  there was nothin' else in
it.""
     I made one more attempt to further matters. "You didn't
have any  key?"
     "Neverr used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened
thee door 'isself an' shut it again when I druv off.  I don't
remember the  last time, but that was the beer."

     "And you can't remember the number of the house?"
     "No, sir.   But ye needn't have no difficulty about that.
It's a   'igh  'un  with a stone front with a bow on it,  an'
'igh steps up to the door.  I know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to
carry  thhe  boxes up with three  loafers  what come round to
eearn a copper.  The  old gent  give them shillin's, an' they
seein' theyy got so much, they wanted more.  But  'e took one
of  them  by the shoulder and was  like to throw 'im down the
steps, till tthe lot of them went away cussin'."

     I thought that with  this  description I could find the
house, so  having paid my friend for his information,I start-
edd off for Piccadilly.I had gained a new painful experience.
The Count coould, it was evident, handle the earth boxes him-
selff. If so, time was precious, for now that he had achieved
a certain amouunt of distribution, he  could, by choosing his
own tiime, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus
I discharged my  cab, and walked westward.  Beyond the Junior
Constituutional I came across the house described and was sat-
isfied  that  this  was  the  next  of the lairs arranged by
Dracula.   The house looked as though it had been long unten-
aanted.  The  windows  were  encrusted  with  dust,  and  the
shutters weere up. All the framework was black with time, and
froom the iron the paint had mostly scaled away.  It was evi-
dent that up  to lately there had  been a  large notice board
in frront of the balcony.  It had, however, been roughly torn
away, the uprigghts which had  supported  it still remaining.
Behind  the rails of the balcony  I saw there were some loose
boards, whose raw edges looked white.  I would  have given a
good deall to have been able  to see the notice board intact,
aas it would, perhaps, have given  some clue to the ownership
of the housse.  I  remembered my experience of the investiga-
tioon and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that I
could find thhe former owner there might be some means disco-
veredd of gaining access to the house.
      There was  at  present  nothing to  be learned from the
Piccadilly sside, and nothing could be done, so I went around
to tthe back to see if anything could be  gathered  from this
quarter.  The  mews were active, the Piccadilly  houses being
mostlyy in occupation.  I asked one or two of  the grooms and
helpers whom I ssaw around  if they  could  tell me  anything
about thhe empty house. One of them said that he heard it had

lately been taken, but he couldn't say from whom.He told me,
however,thhat up to very lately there had been a notice board
off "For Sale" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons,  &  Candy
the house aggents could tell me something, as he  thought  he
remeembered seeing the name of that firm on  the board. I did
not wish to seeem too eager, or to let my  informant  know or
guess  too much,so thanking him in the  usual manner,I strol-
led away.  It waas now growing dusk, and the autumn night was
closing  in, so I did not lose any time.  Having  learned the

address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy  from a  directory at the
Berkeley,  I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.
      The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in man-
ner, but uncommmunicative  in equal proportion.  Having  once
told mee  that the Piccadilly house, which throughout our in-
terview he called a "mansion," was sold,  he  considered  my
business  as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, he
oopened his eyes a thought wider, and  paused a  few  seconds
before repllying,  "It is sold, sir."
     "Parrdon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have
aa special reason for wishing to know who purchased it."
     Again he paaused longer,  and  raised his eyebrows still
more.  ""It is sold, sir," was again his laconic reply.
     ""Surely," I said, "you do  not  mind letting me know so
much."
     "BuBut  I  do  mind," he answered.  "The affairs of their

clients  are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons,
& Candy.""
     This was manifestly a prig of the first water,and there
was no usse arguing with him.  I thought I had  best meet him
oon his own ground, so I said,  "Your clients, sir, are happy
in having sso resolute a guardian of their  confidence.  I am
mysself a professional man."
     Here  I handed him my card.  "In  this instance I am not
prrompted by curiosity, I act on the part  of Lord Godalming,
who wishes tto know something of the property which  was,  he
undeerstood, lately for sale."
     Thesse words  put a different complexion on affairs.  He
ssaid,  "I would like  to  oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker,
and especiaally would I like to oblige his lordship.  We once
carrried out a small matter  of renting some chambers for him
when he was tthe Honorable Arthur Holmwood.  If  you will let
me haave his lordship's address I will  consult the  House on
the subject, annd  will, in  any case, communicate  with  his
lordshiip by tonight's post.  It will be a pleasure if we can
so far deviate from our rules as to give the required infor-
mation too his lordship."
      I wanted to  secure a friend, and not to make an enemy,
so I thankeed him, gave  the address at Dr. Seward's and came
awaay.  It was now dark, and I  was tired and  hungry.  I got
a cup of tea  at the Aerated Bread Company  and came  down to
Purflleet by the next train.
     I foundd all the others at home.  Mina was looking tired
and  pale,  but  she made  a  gallant effort to be bright and
cheerful.  It  wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep
anythiing from her and so  caused her inquietude.  Thank God,
this  will  be   the last night of her looking on at our con-
ferencess, and feeling  the sting of our not showing our con-

fidence.  It took  all my  courage to hold to the wise reso-
lution of  keeping her out of our grim task.  She seems some-
hoow more reconciled, or  else the very subject seems to have
become repuggnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is
madee she actually shudders. I am glad we made our resolution
in time,as witth such a feeling as this,our growing knowledge
would  be torture to her.
     I could nott tell the others of the day's discovery till
we were   alone, so  after dinner, followed by a little music

to save appearances even amongst ourselves, I took  Mina  to
her room aand left her to go to bed.  The  dear girl was more
afffectionate with me than ever,and clung to me as though she
would  detaiin  me,  but there was much to be talked of and I
camee away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made
no difference  between us.
      When I  came down again I found the others all gathered
round the fire  in the study.  In  the train I had written my
diary sso far, and  simply  read  it  off to them as the best
means of letting them get abreast of my own information.
     When I hhad finished Van Helsing said,  "This has been a
greatt day's work, friend Jonathan.  Doubtless we are on  the
track of  the   missing  boxes.  If we  find them all in that
house,  then our work is near the end.  But  if there be some
missing, we must search until we find them.  Then  shall  we
make our  final coup, and hunt the wretch to his real death."
      We all sat silent awhile and  all  at  once  Mr. Morris
spoke,  "Saay!  How are we going to get into that house?"
     "WWe got into the other,"answered Lord Godalming quickly.
     "But, Art,  this is different.  We broke house at Carfax,
but we  had night and a walled park to protect us. It will be
a mighty different thing to commit burglary  in  Piccadilly,
either byy day or night.  I confess  I  don't see how  we are
ggoing to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of
some sort.""
     Lord Godalmming's  brows contracted, and he stood up and
walked aabout the room.By-and-by he stopped and said, turning

from one to another of us,   "Quincey's head is level.  This
burglary bbusiness  is  getting serious.  We got off once all
riight,  but  we  have now a rare job on hand.  Unless we can
find the Couunt's key basket."
     As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it
would  bee  at  least  advisable  to wait till Lord Godalming
sshould hear  from Mitchell's, we decided not to take any ac-
tive  step  before breakfast  time.  For  a good while we sat
andd smoked, discussing  the matter in its various lights and
bearings.  I   took  the opportunity  of  bringing this diary
rightt  up to  the  moment.  I am very sleepy and shall go to
bed . . .
       Just a line.  Mina  sleeps soundly and her breathing is
regular.  Her  forehead is puckered  up into little wrinkles,
as thoough she thinks even in her sleep.  She  is  still  too
pale, but does nnot look so haggard as she did this  morning.
Tomorroww will, I hope, mend all this.  She  will  be herself

at home in Exeter.  Oh, but I am sleepy!

 DR. SEWARARD'S DIARY

       1 October.--I  am  puzzled  afresh about Renfield.  His
moods change  sso  rapidly  that  I find it difficult to keep
touch oof them, and as they always  mean something  more than
his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study.
This  morrning, when I went to see him after his  repulse  of
VVan Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
He was, inn fact, commanding destiny,subjectively. He did not
reeally care for any of the things  of  mere earth, he was in
the clouds aand looked down on  all the weaknesses  and wants
of uus poor mortals.
      I thought  I would improve the occasion and learn some-
thing, so II asked him,  "What about the flies these times?"
      He smiled  on  me in quite a superior sort of way, such
a smile as wouuld  have become  the  face  of Malvolio, as he
answerred me, "The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature.
It's  wings aree typical  of the aerial powers of the psychic
facultiies. The ancients did well when they typified the soul
as a butterfly!"
     I thought  I would push his analogy to its utmost logi-
cally, soo I  said quickly,  "Oh, it  is a soul you are after
nnow, is it?"
      His madness foiled his reason,and a puzzled look spread
over his face aas, shaking his  head  with a decision which I
had butt seldom seen in him.
     He said,   "Oh, no, oh no!  I want no souls. Life is all
I wantt."  Here he  brightened up.  "I  am pretty indifferent
about it at pressent.  Life is all right.  I have all I want.
You mustt get  a new patient,  doctor,  if  you wish to study

zoophagy!"
     TThis  puzzled me a little, so I drew him on.  "Then you
command life.  YYou are a god, I suppose?"
     He ssmiled with an ineffably benign superiority. "Oh no!
FFar be  it from  me to  arrogate to myself the attributes of
the Deity.  I am not even concerned in His especially spirit-
uall doings.  If I may state my intellectual  position I  am,
so far as conncerns things purely terrestrial,somewhat in the
posittion which Enoch occupied spiritually!"
     This was  a poser to me.I could not at the moment recall
Enoch''s  appositeness,  so  I  had to ask a simple question,
though I felt thhat by so doing I was lowering  myself in the
eyes of  the lunatic.  "And why with Enoch?"
     "Because he walked with God."
     I could not see  the analogy, but did not like to admit
it, so  II  harked back to what he had denied.  "So you don't
ccare about life and  you don't want souls.  Why not?"  I put
my questionn quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to dis-
conncert him.
     Thhe effort  succeeded,  for an instant he unconsciously
relapsed into  his  old  servile manner, bent low before me,
and  actuually fawned  upon me  as he replied.  "I don't want
aany souls, indeed, indeed!  I don't.  I couldn't use them if
I had them.. They would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't
eatt them or . . ."
      He  suddenly  stopped and  the old  cunning look spread
over his faace, like a wind sweep on the surface of the water.
      "And doctor, as to life, what  is  it after  all?  When
you've got aall you require, and you know that you will never
wantt, that is all.  I have friends, good friends,  like you,
Dr. Seward."Thhis was said with a leer of inexpressible cunn-
ing.   "I know that I shall never lack the means of life!"
      I think that through the cloudiness of  his insanity he
saw some anntagonism in me, for he at  once  fell back on the
lasst refuge of such as he, a  dogged silence.  After a short
time I saw thhat for the present  it  was useless to speak to
him.   He was sulky, and so I came away.

     Later in the  day  he  sent for me.  Ordinarily I would
not have ccome  without special  reason, but  just at present
I  am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort.
Besides, I  am glad to have anything to help pass  the  time.
Harrker is out, following up clues, and so are Lord Godalming
and Quincey.   Van Helsing sits in my study  poring over  the
recorrd prepared by the Harkers.  He seems to  think  that by
accurate knowleedge of all details he will light  up on  some
clue.   He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without
cause.  I would have taken him with me to  see the  patient,
only I thhought that after his last repulse he might not care
tto go again.  There was also another reason.  Renfield might
not speak sso freely before a third person as when  he  and I
werre alone.
     I   found him  sitting in the middle of the floor on his

stool, a pose which is  generally indicative  of some mental
energy on  his part.  When I  came in,  he  said  at once, as
thhough the  question had  been  waiting  on his lips.  "What
about souls??"
     It  was  eevident then that my surmise had been correct.
Unconsccious  cerebration  was  doing its work, even with the
lunatic.  I determined to have the matter out.
      "What about them yourself?" I asked.
     He did not  reply for a moment but looked all around him,
and up  and down, as though he expected to find some inspira-
tion for an answer.
     "I don't  want any souls!"  He  said in a feeble, apolo-
getic  way.  The matter seemed preying on his mind,  and so I
determined  to uuse it, to  "be cruel only to be kind."  So I
said,  ""You like life, and you want life?"

     "Oh yes! But that is all right. You needn't worry about
that!"
       "But," I asked,"how are we to get the life without get-
ting the souul also?"
     Thiis seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up, "A nice

time you'll have some time when you're flying out here, with
the souls  of thousands  of flies and spiders and  birds  and
caats  buzzing  and  twittering  and  moaning all around you.
You've got ttheir lives, you know, and  you  must put up with
theiir souls!"
     Soomething seemed  to affect his imagination, for he put
his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,  screwing them up
tightly   just  as  a  small boy  does when his face is being
ssoaped.  There was something pathetic in it that touched me.
It also gavve me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a
chiild, only a  child, though the features were worn, and the
stubble on  tthe jaws was  white.  It was evident that he was
underrgoing some  process  of mental disturbance, and knowing
how his past  mmoods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
to himsself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as
I could and go with him
     The   first  step  was to restore confidence, so I asked
hiim, speaking  pretty  loud so that he would hear me through
his closed eears,"Would you like some sugar to get your flies
arouund again?"
     HHe  seemed to  wake up all at once, and shook his head.
With a laugh he  replied,  "Not much!  Flies are poor things,
after alll!"  After a pause he added, "But I don't want their

souls buzzing round me, all the same."
     "Or spideers?" I went on.
      "Blow spiders!  What's the use of spiders?  There isn't
anything inn them to eat or . . ."  He  stopped  suddenly  as
thoough reminded of a forbidden topic.

     "So, so!" I thought to myself, "this is the second time
he has sudddenly stopped at the  word  `drink'.  What does it
meean?"
     Renfielld  seemed  himself aware of having made a lapse,
for  he hurried on,  as though  to distract my attention from
it,  "I don't  take any stock at  all in such matters.  `Rats
and miice  and  such small  deer,'  as  Shakespeare  has  it,
`chicken feed off the larder'  they might be called. I'm past
all thatt sort of nonsense.  You  might  as well ask a man to

eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks, as to try to inter-
est me aboout the  less  carnivora,  when  I know  of what is
beefore me."
     "II see,"  I said."You want big things that you can make
your teeth meet in?  How  would you like  to breakfast on an
elephant??"
     "What  riddiculous  nonsense you are talking?"   He  was
gettingg too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard.
     "I wonder,"  I  said reflectively,  "what an elephant's
soul is llike!"
     The efffect  I desired was obtained, for he at once fell
froom his high-horse and became a child again.
     "I doon't want  an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!"
hee said.  For a few moments  he  sat despondently.  Suddenly
he jumped too his feet,  with his  eyes  blazing  and all the
signns of intense cerebral excitement.  "To hell with you and
your souls!" hhe shouted.  "Why do you plague me about souls?
Haven''t I  got enough to worry, and pain, to distract me al-
ready, without tthinking of souls?"
     He looked sso hostile that I thought he was in for anot-
her homiicidal fit, so I blew my whistle.
      The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and
said apologeetically,  "Forgive me, Doctor.  I forgot myself.
You  do not need any help.  I am so worried in my mind that I
am apt to be iirritable.  If you only knew the problem I have
to facce, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tol-
erate, and pardoon me.  Pray do not put me in a strait waist-
coat. I  want to think and I cannot think freely when my body

is confined.  I am sure you will understand!"
     Hee had evidently self-control,  so  when the attendants
came I told them  not  to mind, and they withdrew.  Renfield
watched tthem go.  When the door was closed he said with con-
ssiderable dignity and sweetness,  "Dr. Seward, you have been
very considderate towards me.  Believe me that I am very,very
graateful to you!"
      I  thought  it well to leave him in this mood, and so I
came away.   There is  certainly  something to ponder over in
thiss man's state.  Several  points  seem  to  make  what the
American interrviewer calls "a story,"  if one could only get
them iin proper order.  Here they are:
      Will not mention "drinking."
      Fears the thought of being  burdened with the "soul" of
anything.
       Has no dread of wanting "life" in the future.
      Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he
dreads being haaunted by their souls.
     Logicallly all these things point one way!  He has assu-
rancee of some kind that he will acquire some higher life.

     He dreads the consequence, the burden of a soul.Then it
is a humann life he looks to!
     And the asssurance . . . ?
      Merciful God!  The Count  has been to him, and there is
some new schheme of terror afoot!

     Later.-.--I went after  my  round to Van Helsing and told
him  my suspicion. He grew very grave, and after thinking the
matter over foor a while asked me to take him to Renfield.  I
did soo.  As we came to the door we heard the lunatic  within
singing gaily, aas he used to do in the time which  now seems
so long  ago.
     When  wwe  entered  we  saw  with  amazement that he had
spreead  out his  sugar as of old.  The flies, lethargic with
the  autumn, wwere beginning to buzz into the room.  We tried
to makke him talk of the subject of our previous conversation,
but he would  nnot attend.  He went on with his singing, just
as thouugh  we had not  been  present.  He had got a scrap of
paper  and was  folding  it into a notebook.  We had to come
away as iignorant as we went in.
     His is  a curious case indeed. We must watch him tonight.

DR. SEWAWARD'S DIARY

       2 October.--I  placed a man in the corridor last night,
and told him tto make an  accurate note of any sound he might
hear ffrom Renfield's  room,  and gave  him instructions that
if there should  be anything strange he was to call me. After
dinner,  when we had all gathered round the fire in the study,
Mrs. Harker having gone to bed,we discussed the attempts and
discoveriies of the day.  Harker was the only one who had any
rresult, and we are in great hopes  that his  clue  may be an
important oone.
     Before   going to bed I went round to the patient's room
and llooked in through the observation trap.  He was sleeping
soundly, his heeart rose and fell with regular respiration.
     Thiss  morning  the  man  on  duty reported to me that a
llittle  after  midnight  he was restless and kept saying his
prayers sommewhat loudly.  I  asked  him if that was all.  He
repplied that it was all he heard.  There was something about
his manner, sso suspicious that I asked him point blank if he
had   been  asleep.  He  denied sleep, but admitted to having
"dozed" for a wwhile.It is too bad that men cannot be trusted
unless  they are watched.
     Today Harker is  out following up his clue, and Art and
Quincey aare looking after horses.  Godalming  thinks that it
wwill be well to have horses  always in  readiness,  for when
we  get thee information  which we seek there will be no time
to  lose.  We must  sterilize all  the imported earth between
sunrise and ssunset.  We  shall  thus catch  the Count at his
weakeest, and without a refuge to fly to.  Van Helsing is off
to the British  Museum looking up some authorities on ancient
medicinne.  The old physicians took account of  things  which
their followers do not accept,and the Professor is searching
for witchh and demon cures which may be useful to us later.
      I sometimes think we must be all mad and that  we shall
wake to sanitty in strait waistcoats.

Later.--W-We have met again.We seem at last to be on the track,

and our work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end.  I
wonder if  Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this. His
mooods have so followed the doings  of the  Count,  that  the
coming destrruction of the monster may be carried to him some
subttle way. If we could only get some hint as to what passed
in his mind, bbetween the time of my  argument with him today
and  hhis  resumption of  fly-catching, it  might afford us a
valuable clue.   He is now  seemingly quiet for a spell . . .
Is he?   That wild yell seemed to come from his room . . .
      The  attendant  came  bursting into my room and told me
that Renfieldd  had  somehow met with some  accident.  He had
heardd  him yell, and when he went to him found him lying  on
his face on thee floor, all covered with blood.  I must go at
once .  . .


CHAPTER 2R 21

         DR. . SEWARD'S DIARY


     3 October.--Let me  put  down  with  exactness all that
happened,  as well as I can remember, since  last  I  made an
enntry.  Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten. In
all calmnesss I must proceed.

     When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the
floor on hhis left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I
weent to move him, it became at once apparent that he had re-
ceived some  terrible injuries.There seemed none of the unity
of ppurpose between the  parts of  the body  which marks even
lethargic saniity.  As the face was  exposed I could see that
it wass horribly bruised,as though it had been beaten against
the floor.  Indeeed it was from the face wounds that the pool
of bloodd originated.
      The attendant who was kneeling beside  the body said to
me as we turneed him over,  "I think, sir, his back is broken.
See,  both his  right arm and leg  and the  whole side of his
face are paralyysed."  How  such  a thing could have happened
puzzledd the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite bewil-
dered, and his brows were gathered in as he said,  "I  can't
understannd the two things.  He could mark his face like that
bby beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do
it once  att  the Eversfield Asylum before anyone  could  lay
hannds on her. And I suppose he might have broken his neck by
falling out oof bed, if he got in an awkward  kink.  But  for
the llife of me I can't imagine how  the two things occurred.
If his back wass broke, he couldn't beat his head, and if his
face waas like that before the fall out of bed,there would be
marks of it."
      I said to him,  "Go to  Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to
kindly come  here at once.  I  want  him without an instant's
delaay."
     The man  ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor,
in hhis  dressing gown and slippers,  appeared.  When  he saw
Renfield on thhe ground, he looked keenly at him a moment,and
then tturned to me.  I think he recognized  my thought in  my
eyes, for he saiid very quietly,  manifestly for the  ears of
the atteendant, "Ah, a sad accident!  He will need very care-

ful watching, and much attention.  I shall stay with you my-
self, but  I shall first dress myself.  If you  will remain I
shhall in a few minutes join you."
      The patient was now breathing  stertorously  and it was
easy to see tthat he had suffered some terrible injury.
     Van Heelsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bear-
ingg with him a surgical case. He had evidently been thinking
and had his mmind made up, for almost before he looked at the
patieent, he whispered to me,  "Send the  attendant away.  We
must be alone wwith him when he becomes conscious,  after the
operatiion."
     I  saidd,  "I think that  will do now, Simmons.  We have
donee all  that we  can  at present.  You had better go  your
round,and Dr.  Van Helsing will operate.  Let me know instant-
ly iff there be anything unusual anywhere."
     The man wiithdrew, and we went into a strict examination
of the  patient.  The wounds of the face were superficial.The
real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending
right up  through the motor area.
     The Prrofessor thought a moment and said,"We must reduce
thee pressure and get back to normal conditions,as far as can
be.  The rapiidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature
of hiis injury.  The whole motor  area  seems  affected.  The
suffusion of thhe brain will increase quickly, so we must tre-
phine  at once or it may be too late."
      As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door.
I went over  and opened it and found in the corridor without,
Arthhur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers,the former spoke,
"I heard your  man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an
accideent.  So I woke Quincey or rather  called for him as he
was  not asleep..  Things  are  moving  too  quickly  and too
strangelly for sound sleep for any  of us these  times.  I've

been  thinking  that  tomorrow  night will not see things as
they have   been.  We'll  have  to  look  back, and forward a
liittle more than we have done.  May we come in?"
     II nodded, and held the door open till they had entered,
then I closed itt again.  When  Quincey saw  the attitude and
state off  the  patient, and noted  the horrible pool  on the

floor, he said softly,  "My God!  What has  happened to him?
Poor, poorr devil!"
     I ttold him briefly, and added that we expected he would

recover consciousness after the operation, for a short time,
at all eveents.  He  went at once and sat down on the edge of
thhe  bed,  with  Godalming  beside  him.  We  all watched in
patience.
 
     "We shall wait," said Van Helsing, "just long enough to
fix the besst spot for trephining,so that we may most quickly
andd perfectly remove the blood  clot, for it is evident that
the haemorrhaage is increasing."
     The minutess during  which we waited passed with fearful
slownesss.  I  had  a  horrible sinking in my heart, and from

Van Helsing's  face  I  gathered  that  he felt some fear or
apprehensiion as  to what was  to  come.  I dreaded the words
Reenfield might speak.  I was positively afraid to think. But
the convictiion of what was coming was on me, as I have  read
of mmen who have heard the death watch.The poor man's breath-
ing came in unncertain gasps.Each instant he seemed as though
he wouuld open his eyes  and speak, but then would  follow  a
prolonged stertoorous breath,and he would relapse into a more
fixed innsensibility.  Inured as I was to sick beds and death,
this suspense grew and grew upon me. I could almost hear the
beating oof my own heart, and the  blood  surging  through my
ttemples sounded like blows from a hammer.The silence finally
became agonnizing.  I looked at my companions, one after ano-
theer, and saw from their  flushed faces  and damp brows that
they  were ennduring equal torture.  There was a nervous sus-
pensee over us all, as  though overhead some dread bell would
peal out powerffully when we should least expect it.
     At last  thhere came a time when it was evident that the
patient  was sinking fast.  He  might  die at  any moment.  I

looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine.
His face  was sternly set as he spoke,  "There is no time  to
llose.  His words may be worth many lives. I have been think-
ing so, as  I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!
We  shall operate just above the ear."

     Without another word he made the operation.  For a  few
moments thhe breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there
caame a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would
tear open hiis chest.  Suddenly his eyes  opened,  and became
fixeed in a wild, helpless stare.This was continued for a few
moments, then  it was softened into a glad surprise, and from
his liips came a sigh of relief.He moved convulsively, and as
he did so, said,,  "I'll be quiet, Doctor.  Tell them to take
off the  strait waistcoat.  I have had a  terrible dream, and

it has left me so weak that I cannot move. What's wrong with
my face?   It feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully."
      He tried to turn his head, but even with the effort his
eyes seemed too grow glassy again so I  gently put  it  back.
Then VVan Helsing said in a quiet grave tone,  "Tell  us your
dream, Mr. Renfiield."
     As  hee heard the voice his face brightened, through its
muttilation,  and  he  said,  "That  is Dr. Van Helsing.  How
good it is off you to be here.  Give me  some  water, my lips
are ddry, and I shall try to tell you.  I dreamed" . . .
      He stopped and  seemed fainting.  I called  quietly  to
Quincey,  "TThe  brandy,  it is in my study, quick!"  He flew
and   returned  with  a  glass,  the decanter of brandy and a
carafe  of  waater.  We moistened  the  parched lips, and the
patiennt quickly revived.
     It  seemed,,  however, that  his  poor injured brain had
been worrking in the interval,for when he was quite conscious,
he looked at me piercingly  with an agonized confusion which
I shall nnever forget, and said,  "I must not deceive myself.
IIt was no dream,  but  all  a  grim reality."  Then his eyes
roved  rounnd  the  room.  As  they  caught  sight of the two
figgures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on,
"If I were noot sure already, I would know from them."
     For  ann instant his eyes closed, not with pain or sleep
but  voluntarily,as though he were bringing all his faculties
to bear.  Whenn  he  opened them he said, hurriedly, and with
more eenergy than he had yet displayed,  "Quick, Doctor,quick,
I am dying! I ffeel that I have but a few minutes, and then I
must goo back to death, or worse!  Wet my  lips  with  brandy
again.  I have something that I must  say before I  die.  Or
before myy poor crushed brain dies anyhow.  Thank you! It was
tthat night after you left me, when I implored you  to let me
go away.  II couldn't speak then, for I felt  my  tongue  was
tieed.  But I was as sane then, except in that way,  as  I am
now.  I was iin an agony of despair for a long time after you
left  me, it seemed hours.  Then there came a sudden peace to
me.  My brain sseemed to become cool again,  and  I  realized
where II was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not
where He was!"
      As he spoke,  Van Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his
hand came oout and met mine and gripped it hard.  He did not,
howwever, betray  himself.  He nodded slightly and said,  "Go
on," in a loww voice.
     Renffield  proceeded.  "He came  up to the window in the
mmist, as I had seen him often before, but he was solid then,
not  a  ghoost,  and  his eyes  were fierce like a man's when
anggry.  He was laughing with his  red mouth, the sharp white
teeth glintedd in the  moonlight  when he turned to look back
over  the belt of trees, to  where  the dogs were barking.  I
wouldn't ask hiim to come in at first,though I knew he wanted
to, jusst as he had wanted all along. Then he began promising
me things, not in words but by doing them."
     He  was interrupted by a word from the Professor, "How?"

     "By making them happen.  Just as he used to send in the
flies whenn the  sun  was  shining.  Great big  fat ones with
stteel and sapphire on their wings.  And  big  moths,  in the
night, with  skull and cross-bones on their backs."
     Van Helsiing nodded to him as he whispered to  me uncon-
scioussly,  "The Acherontia Atropos of the Sphinges, what you
call the `Death''s-head Moth'?"
      The patient went on  without  stopping,  "Then he began
to whisper.``Rats, rats, rats!  Hundreds, thousands, millions
of tthem, and every one a life.And dogs to eat them, and cats
too. All livess! All red blood, with years of life in it, and
not meerely buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to
see what he coulld do.  Then the dogs howled, away beyond the
dark treees in His house. He beckoned me to the window. I got

up and looked out,and He raised his hands,and seemed to call
out withouut using any words.  A  dark  mass  spread over the
grrass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire. And then
He moved thee mist to the right and left,and I could see that
therre were thousands of rats  with their  eyes  blazing red,
like His only  smaller.  He  held  up his  hand, and they all
stoppeed, and I thought he  seemed to be saying,  `All  these
lives will I givve you, ay,and many more and greater, through
countlesss ages, if you will  fall down and worship me!'  And

then a red cloud, like the  color of  blood, seemed to close
over my eyyes, and before  I knew  what  I was doing, I found
myyself opening the  sash and  saying to Him,  `Come in, Lord
and Master!''  The  rats  were all gone, but He slid into the
roomm through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide,
just as the Mooon herself has often come in through the tini-
est crrack  and  has  stood  before  me  in all  her size and
splendor."
       His  voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the
brandy again,   and he continued, but it seemed as though his
memoryy had gone on working in the interval for his story was
further advancedd.  I was about to call him back to the point,
but Vann Helsing whispered  to  me,  "Let him go  on. Do  not
interrupt him.  He cannot go back, and maybe could  not pro-
ceed at aall if once he lost the thread of his thought."
     HHe proceeded,  "All day I waited to hear from him,  but
he did not send  me anything, not even a blowfly,and when the
moon gott up I was pretty angry with him.When he did slide in

through the window, though it was shut,  and  did  not  even
knock, I ggot mad with him.  He  sneered at me, and his white
faace looked out of the mist with  his red eyes gleaming, and
he went on aas though he owned  the whole place, and I was no
one..  He  didn't  even  smell the  same as he went by me.  I
couldn't hold  him.  I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had
come iinto the room."
      The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came  over,
standing behhind him so that he could not see them, but where
theyy could hear better.  They were both silent, but the Pro-
fessor startedd and quivered.  His face, however,grew grimmer
and stterner still.  Renfield went on without noticing, "When
Mrs. Harker camee in to see me this afternoon she  wasn't the
same.  IIt was like tea after  the teapot  has been watered."

Here we all moved, but no one said a word.
     He weent on,  "I didn't know that  she was here till she
sppoke, and she didn't look the same.  I  don't  care for the
pale people..  I  like them with  lots  of blood in them, and
herss all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it at the
time, but whenn she went away I began to think,and it made me
mad too know that He had been taking the life out of her."  I
could feel that  the rest quivered, as I did. But we remained
otherwisse still.  "So when He came tonight I  was ready  for

Him.  I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight.  I
had heard  that madmen have unnatural strength. And as I knew
I  was a madman, at times anyhow, I resolved to use my power.
Ay, and He ffelt it too,for He had to come out of the mist to
struuggle with me. I held tight, and I thought I was going to
win,for I didnn't mean Him to take any more of her life, till
I saw  His eyes.  They burned into me, and my strength became
like water. He sslipped through it, and when I tried to cling
to Him,   He raised me up and flung me down.  There was a red

cloud before me,and a noise like thunder,and the mist seemed
to steal aaway under the door."
     His voicee was becoming fainter and his breath more ster-
torouus.  Van Helsing stood up instinctively.
     "We knoww the worst now," he said.  "He is here, and  we
know  his purpose.  It may not be too late.  Let us be armed,
the same as we  were the other night, but lose no time, there
is not  an instant to spare."
     There waas no  need to put our fear, nay our conviction,
into  words,  we  shared them in  common.  We all hurried and
took from  our  rooms  the same  things  that we  had when we
enteredd the Count's house.  The Professor had his ready, and
as we met in the corridor he pointed to  them  significantly
as he saiid,  "They never leave me, and they shall  not  till
tthis unhappy business is over.  Be wise also, my friends. It
is no commoon enemy that we deal with  Alas! Alas!  That dear
Maddam Mina should suffer!" He stopped,his voice was breaking,
and I do nott know if rage or  terror  predominated in my own
hearrt.
     Outside   the  Harkers' door we paused.  Art and Quincey
held bback, and the latter said,  "Should we disturb her?"
      "We must,"  said  Van Helsing  grimly.  "If the door be
locked, I sshall break it in."
     "May it  noot  frighten her  terribly?  It is unusual to
break innto a lady's room!"
     Van Helsingg said solemnly,  "You are always right.  But
this is  life and death. All chambers are alike to the doctor.
And even were they not they are all as one  to  me  tonight.
Friend Joohn, when I turn the handle, if  the door  does  not
oopen, do you put your shoulder down and shove.  And you too,
my friends..  Now!"
     He tturned the handle as he spoke,  but the door did not
yyield.  We threw ourselves against it. With a crash it burst
open, and wwe almost fell  headlong  into the room.  The Pro-
fesssor did actually fall,and I saw across him as he gathered
himself up frrom hands and knees.  What I saw appalled me.  I
felt  my hair rise like  bristles on the back of my neck, and
my heart seemedd to stand still.

     The  moonlight  was  so  bright  that through the thick
yellow bliind the room was light  enough  to see.  On the bed
beeside the window  lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and
breathing heeavily as  though  in  a stupor.  Kneeling on the
nearr  edge  of  the  bed  facing outwards was the white-clad
figure of his  wife.  By her side stood a tall, thin man,clad
in blaack.  His face was turned from us, but  the instant  we
saw we all recoggnized the Count, in every way, even  to  the
scar on  his forehead.  With his left hand he  held both Mrs.

Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms at full ten-
sion.  Hiss right hand gripped her by the back of  the  neck,
foorcing her face down on  his bosom.  Her white  night-dress
was smeared  with blood, and a thin stream  trickled down the
man''s bare chest which was shown by his torn-open dress. The
attitude of thhe two had a terrible  resemblance  to  a child
forcinng a kitten's nose into a  saucer  of milk to compel it
to drink.  As wee burst into  the room, the Count  turned his
face, annd the hellish look that I had heard described seemed

to leap into it.  His eyes flamed red with devilish passion.
The great  nostrils  of  the white aquiline nose  opened wide
annd quivered at the edge, and  the white sharp teeth, behind
the full lipps of  the blood dripping mouth, clamped together
likee those of a wild beast.  With a  wrench, which threw his
victim back  uupon the bed as though hurled from a height, he
turnedd and sprang at us.  But by this time the Professor had
gained  his  feeet, and was holding  towards him the envelope
which coontained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped,
just as poor  Lucy  had  done outside the tomb,  and cowered
back.  Fuurther and further back  he  cowered, as we, lifting
oour crucifixes, advanced.  The moonlight suddenly failed, as
a  great  bblack cloud  sailed  across the sky.  And when the
gasslight sprang up under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but
a faint vaporr.  This, as we looked, trailed under the  door,
whichh with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back
to its old posiition.  Van Helsing, Art, and I moved  forward
to Mrs.. Harker,  who by  this  time had drawn her breath and
with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so des-
pairing tthat it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears
ttill my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless
attitude annd disarray.  Her face  was ghastly, with a pallor
whiich was accentuated by the  blood  which  smeared her lips
and cheeks annd chin.  From her throat trickled a thin stream
of bllood. Her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before
her face her pooor  crushed hands, which bore on their white-
ness thhe  red  mark  of the  Count's terrible grip, and from
behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible
scream seeem  only  the quick expression of an endless grief.
VVan Helsing  stepped  forward  and  drew the coverlet gently
over her boody,  whilst Art, after looking at her face for an
insstant despairingly, ran out of the room.
     Van Helssing  whispered to me,  "Jonathan is in a stupor
such  as we know the  Vampire can produce.  We can do nothing
with poor  Madaam  Mina  for  a few moments till she recovers
herselff.  I must wake him!"
     He dippedd the end of a towel in cold water and with  it
began  to flick him on the face, his wife all the while hold-
ing her face bettween her hands and sobbing in a way that was
heart brreaking to hear.  I raised the blind, and  looked out

of the window.  There was much moonshine, and  as I looked I
could  seee  Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide him-
seelf in the shadow of a great yew tree.  It  puzzled  me  to
think why hee was doing this. But at the instant I heard Har-
ker''s quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness,
and turned to  the bed.  On his face, as there might well be,
was a  look of wild amazement.  He seemed dazed for a few se-
conds, and then  full consciousness  seemed to burst upon him
all at oonce, and he started up.
     His wiife was aroused by  the quick movement, and turned
to  him with her arms stretched out,as though to embrace him.
Instantly, hoowever, she drew them in again, and  putting her
elbowws together,held her hands before her face,and shuddered
till the bed beeneath her shook.

     "In God's name what does this mean?"  Harker cried out.
"Dr. Sewarrd, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened?
Whhat is wrong?  Mina, dear what is it?  What does that blood
mean?  My Good, my God!  Has it come to  this!"  And, raising
himsself to his knees,he beat his hands wildly together."Good
God help us!   Help her!  Oh, help her!"
     Withh a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began  to
ppull on his clothes,all the man in him awake at the need for
instant exeertion. "What has happened? Tell me all about it!"
he  cried without pausing.  "Dr. Van Helsing you love Mina, I
know.  Oh, doo something to save her. It cannot have gone too
far yyet.  Guard her while I look for him!"
     His wife,   through  her terror and horror and distress,
saw somme sure danger  to him.  Instantly forgetting her  own
grief, she seized hold of him and cried out.
     "NNo!  No!   Jonathan,  you  must  not leave me.  I have
suffered enough tonight, God knows, without the dread of his
harming yyou.  You must stay with me. Stay with these friends
wwho will watch over you!"  Her expression became frantic  as
she spoke.   And, he yielding to  her,  she pulled  him  down
sittting on the bedside, and clung to him fiercely.
      Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both.The Professor
held  up his  ggolden crucifix, and said with wonderful calm-
ness,   "Do not fear, my dear.  We are here, and whilst  this
is close to you no foul thing can approach. You are safe for
tonight,  and we must be calm and take counsel together."
      She shuddered and was silent, holding down  her head on
her husband's bbreast.  When she raised it, his  white night-
robe waas stained with blood where her lips had touched,  and
where the thin open wound in  the neck had sent forth drops.
The instaant she  saw  it she drew back, with a low wail, and
wwhispered, amidst choking sobs.
      "Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more.
Oh,that it shhould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy,
and  whom he may have most cause to fear."
     To this hee spoke out resolutely,  "Nonsense, Mina.It is
a shamee to me to hear such a word.  I would not hear  it  of
you.  And I shall not hear it from you.  May God judge me by
my desertts, and punish me with  more bitter  suffering  than
eeven this hour, if by any act or will of  mine anything ever
come betweeen us!"
     He puut out his arms and folded her to his  breast.  And
foor a while she lay there sobbing.  He looked at us over her
bowed head,wwith eyes that blinked damply above his quivering
nosttrils.  His mouth was set as steel.

     After a  while  her sobs became  less frequent and more
faint, andd then he said to me, speaking with a studied calm-
neess which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost.
     "And now, DDr. Seward, tell  me all  about it.  Too well
I know tthe broad fact.  Tell me all that has been."
     I toold him exactly what had  happened  and  he listened
wwith seeming impassiveness, but  his  nostrils twitched  and
his eyes  bblazed  as  I  told  how the ruthless hands of the
Couunt had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position,
with her mouuth to the open wound in his breast.It interested
me,  even at that moment,to see that whilst the face of white
set  passion   worked  convulsively  over the bowed head, the
hands  tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled  hair.  Just
as I had finisheed, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.
They enntered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked
at me questioningly.  I understood him to mean if we were to
take advaantage of their coming  to divert  if  possible  the
tthoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and
from themseelves.  So on nodding acquiescence to him he asked
theem what they had seen or  done.  To  which  Lord Godalming
answered.
       "I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any
of our roomss.  I looked in the study but, though he had been
therre,  he  had  gone.  He  had,  however . . ."  He stopped
suddenly, lookking at the poor drooping figure on the bed.
     Van  Helsing said gravely,  "Go  on,  friend Arthur.  We
wwant here no more concealments.  Our hope now  is in knowing
all.  Tell  freely!"
     So  Art went on, "He had been there, and though it could

only have been for a few seconds, he made rare  hay  of  the
place.  Alll  the  manuscript  had  been burned, and the blue
fllames were flickering  amongst the white ashes.  The cylin-
ders of yourr phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the
wax  had helped the flames."
     Here II interrupted.  "Thank God there is the other copy
in  the safe!"
     HHis face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on.
"I ran downstaiirs  then,  but  could  see no sign of him.  I
looked  into  Renfield's room,  but  there was no trace there
except . . ."  Again he paused.
      "Go on," said Harker hoarsely. So he bowed his head and
moistening hhis lips with his tongue, added, "except that the
poorr fellow is dead."
     Mrs. Harker raised  her  head,  looking from one to the
other of  us she said solemnly,  "God's will be done!"
     I   could  not  but feel that Art was keeping back some-

thing.  But, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said
nothing.

     Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked,"And you, friend
Quincey, hhave you any to tell?"
     "A  litttle,"  he answered.  "It may be much eventually,
but aat present  I can't  say.  I thought it well to  know if
possible where  the Count would go when he left the house.  I
did nott see him, but I saw a bat rise from Renfield's window,
and flap westwarrd.  I expected to see him in some  shape  go
back to  Carfax, but he evidently sought some other lair.  He

will not be back tonight, for the sky  is  reddening in  the
east, and  the dawn is close.  We must work tomorrow!"
     He ssaid the latter words through his shut teeth.  For a
sspace of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence,and I
could fancyy  that I could hear the sound of our hearts beat-
ingg.
     Then Van HHelsing said, placing his hand tenderly on Mrs.
Harkerr's head,  "And now, Madam Mina, poor dear, dear, Madam
Mina, tell us exxactly what happened. God knows that I do not
want thaat you be pained, but it is need that we know all.For

now more than ever has all work to be done  quick and sharp,
and in deaadly earnest.  The day is close to us that must end
alll, if it may be so, and now is the chance that we may live
and learn.""
     The  poor  dear lady shivered, and I could see the ten-
sion of hher nerves as  she clasped her husband closer to her
aand bent her head lower and lower still on his breast.  Then
she raised  her head proudly, and held out one  hand  to  Van
Hellsing who took it in his,and after stooping and kissing it
reverently, hheld it fast.  The other hand was locked in that
of heer husband, who held his other arm thrown round her pro-
tectingly. Afteer a pause in which she was evidently ordering
her thooughts, she began.
     "I took  the sleeping  draught  which you had so kindly
given me,, but for a long time it did  not  act.  I seemed to
bbecome more wakeful, and myriads  of horrible  fancies began
to crowd inn upon my mind.  All of them connected with death,
andd vampires, with blood, and pain, and trouble."  Her  hus-
band involunttarily groaned  as she  turned  to  him and said
lovinngly,  "Do not fret, dear.  You must be brave and strong,
and help me thhrough the horrible task. If you only knew what
an efffort it is to me to tell  of this fearful thing at all,
you would undersstand how much I need your help.  Well, I saw
I must ttry to help the medicine to its work with my will, if

it was to do me any good,so I resolutely set myself to sleep.
Sure enouugh sleep must soon have  come to me, for I remember
nno more.  Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by
my side wheen next I remember. There was in the room the same
thiin white mist that I had before noticed.  But I forget now
if you know   of this.  You will  find it in my diary which I
shalll show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had
come  to  me  bbefore and the same sense of some presence.  I
turned  to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept  so soundly
that  it  seemed as  if it was he who had taken the sleeping
draught,aand not I.  I tried, but I could not wake him.  This
ccaused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified.  Then
indeed,  myy heart sank within me.  Beside the bed,  as if he
hadd stepped out  of the mist, or rather  as if the mist  had
turned  into   his figure,  for  it had entirely disappeared,
stoodd a tall, thin  man, all  in  black.  I knew him at once
from the  descrription  of  the  others.  The waxen face, the
high aqquiline nose, on which the  light fell in a thin white
line, the parted red lips, with the  sharp white teeth show-
ing betweeen,  and  the  red eyes that I had seemed to see in
tthe sunset on the windows  of St. Mary's Church at Witby.  I
knew,  too,,  the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had
strruck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would
have screamedd  out, only that I was paralyzed.  In the pause
he sppoke in a sort of  keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he
spoke to Jonathhan.
     "`Silencce!  If  you  make  a sound I shall take him and
dash  his brains out before your very  eyes.'  I was appalled
and was too bewwildered to do or say anything. With a mocking
smile,  he placed one hand upon my shoulder  and, holding  me
tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he  did so,
`First, aa little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may
aas well be quiet.  It is not the first time,  or the second,
that your vveins have appeased my  thirst!' I was bewildered,
andd strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him.I suppose
it is a part  of the horrible  curse that  such is,  when his
touchh is on his victim.  And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He
placed his reekking lips upon my throat!" Her husband groaned
again.   She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pity-
ingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on.
      "I felt  my strength  fading away,  and I was in a half
swoon.  Howw long this horrible thing lasted  I know not, but
it  seemed that  a long time  must have passed before he took
his foul, awfful, sneering mouth away. I saw it drip with the
freshh blood!"The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower
her, and she drrooped and would  have sunk down  but for  her
husbandd's sustaining arm.  With a great effort she recovered
herself and went on.
     "Then  hhe spoke to me mockingly,  `And so you, like the
otherrs, would play your brains against mine.  You would help
these men to huunt me and frustrate me in my design! You know
now, annd they know in part already, and  will know  in  full
before long, what it is to cross my path.  They  should have
kept theiir energies for use closer to home. Whilst they play-

ed  wits  against  me, against me who commanded nations, and
intrigued  for  them, and  fought for them, hundreds of years
beefore  they were  born, I was countermining them.  And you,
their best   beloved  one, are now  to me, flesh of my flesh,
bloood of my blood, kin  of my  kin, my  bountiful wine-press
for  a  while,,  and  shall be later on  my  companion and my
helperr.  You shall be avenged in turn, for not  one  of them
but shall ministter to your needs.  But as yet you  are to be
punishedd for what you have done. You have aided in thwarting

me. Now you shall come to my call.When my brain says "Come!"
to you, yoou shall cross land or sea to do my bidding. And to
thhat end this!'
      With  that  he pulled open his shirt, and with his long
sharp  nails   opened  a  vein in his breast.  When the blood
begann to spurt out, he took  my hands in one of his, holding
them tight, andd with the other seized my neck and pressed my
mouth   to  the  wound,  so  that  I must either suffocate or
swallow some to the . . .  Oh, my God!  My God!  What have I
done?  Whhat have I done to deserve such a fate, I who   have
ttried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days. God
pity me! Loook down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril.
Annd in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!" Then she began
to rub her llips as though to cleanse them from pollution.
     Ass she was telling her  terrible story, the eastern sky
began to quicken, and everything became more and more clear.
Harker waas still and quiet.  But over his face, as the awful
nnarrative went on, came a grey look which deepened and deep-
ened in thee morning light, till when the first red streak of
thee coming dawn shot up, the  flesh stood darkly out against
the whiteningg hair.
     We haave  arranged that one of us is to stay within call
off the unhappy  pair  till we  can meet together and arrange
about takingg action.
     Of   this  I  am  sure.  The sun  rises today on no more

miserable house in all the great round of its daily course.


CHAPTERTER 22

                   JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

 
     3 October.--As I must do something or go mad,  I  write
this diary..  It is now six o'clock,  and  we are  to meet in
thee study in half an hour and take something to eat, for Dr.
Van Helsing aand Dr. Seward are agreed that  if we do not eat
we caannot work our best.Our best will be, God knows,required
today.  I must  keep writing at every chance, for I dare  not
stop too think.  All, big and little, must go down.Perhaps at
the end the little things may teach us most.The teaching,big
or littlee, could not have landed Mina or  me  anywhere worse
tthan we are today.  However,  we must trust  and hope.  Poor
Mina told mme just now,  with the tears running down her dear
cheeeks, that it is in trouble and  trial  that our faith  is
tested. That  we must keep on trusting, and that God will aid
us upp to  the end.  The  end!  Oh  my  God!  What end? . . .
To work!  To woork!
     When Dr.. Van  Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from
seeinng  poor Renfield,  we went  gravely into what was to be
done.  First,   Dr. Seward told us  that when he  and Dr. Van
Helsingg had gone down to  the room below they had found Ren-
field  lying  on the  floor, all  in  a  heap.  His face was
all bruissed and crushed in, and the  bones  of the neck were
bbroken.
     Dr. SSeward  asked  the attendant who was on duty in the
paassage if he had heard anything.  He said that  he had been
sitting  dowwn, he confessed  to  half dozing, when he  heard
loudd  voices  in  the room, and then Renfield had called out
loudly severall times,  "God!  God!  God!"  After that  there
was  aa sound  of falling, and when  he entered  the room  he
found him lying  on the floor, face down, just as the doctors
had seenn him.  Van Helsing asked if he had heard "voices" or

"a voice," and he said  he could not say.  That  at first it
had seemedd to him as if there were two, but as there  was no
onne in the room it could have been only one.  He could swear
to it, if reequired, that the word  "God" was spoken  by  the
patiient.
     Dr. Sewward said to us, when we were  alone, that he did
not  wish to go into the matter.  The question  of an inquest
had to be conssidered, and  it  would never do to put forward
the trruth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought
that on the atteendant's evidence he could give a certificate
of deathh by misadventure in falling from bed.  In  case  the

coroner should demand it, there would  be a  formal inquest,
necessarilly to the same result.
     When  thhe  question  began  to  be discussed as to what
shoulld be our next step, the very first thing we decided was
that Mina shoulld be in full confidence.  That nothing of any
sort, nno matter how painful, should  be kept from  her.  She
herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful  to  see
her so brrave and yet so sorrowful, and in  such a  depth  of
ddespair.
     "Theere  must be  no concealment," she said.  "Alas!  We
hhave had too much already.  And  besides there is nothing in
all the worrld that can give me more pain than I have already
enddured, than I suffer now!  Whatever may happen, it must be
of new hope oor of new courage to me!"
     Van HHelsing  was  looking at  her fixedly as she spoke,
annd said, suddenly but quietly,  "But dear  Madam Mina,  are
you not afraaid.  Not for yourself, but for others from your-
selff, after what has happened?"
     Heer face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with
the devotion of  a  martyr as she answered,  "Ah no!  For my
mind is mmade up!"
     "Too  what?"  he  asked  gently, whilst we were all very

still, for each in our own way  we  had a sort of vague idea
of what shhe meant.
     Herr answer  came  with direct simplicity, as though she

was simply stating  a fact,  "Because  if  I find in myself,
and I shalll watch keenly  for it, a sign of harm to any that
I  love, I shall die!"
     "You wouldd not kill yourself?" he asked, hoarsely.
     "I  wouuld.  If there  were  no friend who loved me, who
woulld save me such a pain, and so  desperate an effort!" She
looked at him  meaningly as she spoke.
     He wass sitting down, but now he  rose and came close to
herr and put his hand on her head as he  said  solemnly.  "My
child, there  is such an one if it were for  your  good.  For
mysellf I could hold it in my account  with God  to find such
an euthanasia ffor you, even at  this moment if it were best.
Nay, weere it safe!  But my child . . ."
      For a moment he seemed  choked, and a great sob rose in
his throat.   He gulped it down  and went on, "There are here
somee who would stand between you  and  death.  You  must not
die.  You mustt not die  by  any hand, but  least of all your
own.   Until the other, who has  fouled  your  sweet life, is
true dead you muust  not die.  For  if  he is still with  the
quick Unndead, your death would make you even as  he is.  No,

you must live! You must struggle and strive  to live, though
death woulld seem  a boon unspeakable.  You  must fight Death
hiimself,  though he  come  to you in pain or in joy.  By the
day,  or thee  night, in safety  or in peril!  On your living
soull I charge you that you  do not die.  Nay, nor  think  of
death, till thhis great evil be past."
     The pooor  dear grew white as death, and shook and shiv-
ereed,  as  I have  seen  a quicksand shake and shiver at the
incoming of tthe  tide.  We  were  all  silent.  We  could do
nothiing.  At  length she  grew more  calm and turning to him
said  sweetly,  but  oh so  sorrowfully, as  she held out her
hand,   "I promise you, my dear friend, that if  God will let
me live, I shall strive to do so.  Till, if it may be in His
good timee, this horror may have passed away from me."
     Shee  was  so  good  and brave that we all felt that our

hearts were strengthened to work and  endure for her, and we
began to   discuss  what we  were to do.  I told her that she
waas to have all the papers in  the  safe, and all the papers
or diaries   and phonographs  we might hereafter use, and was
to kkeep the record as she had  done before.  She was pleased
with the prosppect of anything to  do,  if "pleased" could be
used iin connection with so grim an interest.
     As usual  Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else,
and wwas prepared with an exact ordering of our work.
      "It  is  perhaps  well,"  he said, "that at our meeting
after our visitt to Carfax we decided not to do anything with
the earrth boxes that lay there.  Had  we  done so, the Count
must  have  guessed  our  purpose, and  would doubtless have
taken meaasures  in  advance to frustrate such an effort with
rregard  to  the others.  But now he does not know our inten-
tions.  Nayy, more, in all probability, he does not know that
succh a power  exists  to  us  as can sterilize his lairs, so
that he cannoot use them as of old.
     "We  aree  now so much further advanced in our knowledge
as too their  disposition  that,  when  we  have examined the
house in Piccaddilly,we may track the very last of them.Today
then, iis ours, and in it rests our hope.  The sun that  rose
on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it
sets toniight, that monster must retain whatever  form he now
hhas.  He is confined within the limitations  of his  earthly
envelope. HHe cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through
craacks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he
must open thee door like a mortal. And so we have this day to
hunt  out all his lairs and  sterilize them.  So we shall, if
we have not yett catch him and  destroy him, drive him to bay
in somee place where the catching and the destroying shall be,
in time, sure.""
     Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the
thought   that  the  minutes  and seconds so preciously laden
wwith  Mina's life and happiness  were  flying from us, since
whilst we ttalked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held
up  his hand warningly.
     "Nay, frieend Jonathan," he said, "in this, the quickest
way homme  is the longest way, so your proverb say.  We shall
all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come.
But thinnk, in all probable the key  of the  situation is  in

that house in Piccadilly.  The Count may  have  many  houses
which he hhas bought.  Of them he will have deeds of purchase,
kkeys and other things.  He will have paper that he write on.
He will havve his book of cheques.  There are many belongings
thaat  he must have somewhere.  Why not in this place so cen-
tral, so quieet,where he come and go by the front or the back
at alll hours, when in the very vast  of the traffic there is
none to notice.. We shall go there and search that house. And
when wee learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Art-
hur call, in his phrases of hunt `stop the earths' and so we
run down  our old fox, so?  Is it not?"
      "Then  let us  come  at once," I cried, "we are wasting
the precious, pprecious time!"
      The Professor did not move, but simply said,  "And  how
are we to geet into that house in Piccadilly?"
      "Any way!" I cried.  "We shall break in if need be."
     "And yourr police?  Where  will they  be,  and what will
they ssay?"
     I was   staggered, but I knew that if he wished to delay
he hhad a  good  reason for it.  So I  said,  as quietly as I
could,  "Don'tt wait more than need be.  You know, I am sure,
what ttorture I am in."

     "Ah, my child,  that I do.  And indeed there is no wish
of me to aadd to your anguish.  But  just  think, what can we
doo, until all the world be at movement.  Then  will come our
time.  I havve thought and thought, and it seems to  me  that
the  simplest way is the best of all.  Now  we  wish  to  get
into the housee, but we have no key.  Is it not so?"I nodded.
     ""Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that
house,  and  couuld not still get in.  And think there was to
you no cconscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?"
      "I should  get a  respectable locksmith, and set him to
work to pickk the lock for me."
     "And your ppolice, they would interfere, would they not?"
     "OOh no! Not if they knew the man was properly employed."
     "Then,"  hee looked  at  me as keenly as he spoke,  "all
that is  in doubt is the conscience of  the employer, and the

belief of your policemen as to whether or  not that employer
has a goodd conscience or a bad one.  Your police must indeed
bee zealous men and  clever, oh  so  clever, in  reading  the
heart, that  they trouble themselves in such matter.  No, no,
my ffriend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty
houses in thiss your London, or of any city in the world, and
if youu do it as such things are rightly done,and at the time
such things are  rightly done, no one will interfere.  I have
read of  a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and

when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up
his  housee,  some  burglar come and broke window at back and
goot in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and
walk out andd in through the door,before the very eyes of the
poliice. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise
it, and put upp big notice. And when the day come he sell off
by a   great  auctioneer  all the goods of that other man who
own them.  Then   he  go  to  a builder, and he sell him that
house, mmaking an agreement that he pull it down and take all

away  within  a  certain  time.  And  your  police and other
authority   help him  all they can.  And when that owner come
baack from his  holiday  in Switzerland he find only an empty
hole where   his house had been.  This was all done en regle,
and  in our work we shall be en regle too. We shall not go so
early  that  tthe policemen who have then little to think of,
shall  deem it  strange.  But  we shall go after ten o'clock,
when there are mmany about,and such things would be done were
we indeeed owners of the house."
     I  couuld  not but see how right he was and the terrible
desspair of Mina's face became relaxed in thought.  There was
hope in such  good counsel.
      Van Helsing  went on,  "When  once within that house we
may find moree  clues.  At  any  rate  some  of us can remain
theree whilst the rest find the other places  where  there be
more earth boxees, at Bermondsey and Mile End."
      Lord Godalming stood up.  "I can be of  some use here,"
he said.  "I  shall wire  to my people  to  have  horses  and
carriiages where they will be most convenient."
     "Look  here, old fellow," said Morris, "it  is a capital
ideea to have all ready in case we want to go  horse backing,
but don't youu think that one  of  your snappy carriages with
its hheraldic adornments in  a byway of Walworth  or Mile End
would attract ttoo much attention for our purpose?  It  seems
to  me  that we ought to take cabs when we go  south or east.
And even  leave them somewhere near  the neighborhood we are
going to.."
     "Friend Quuincey  is right!"  said  the Professor.  "His
head iss what you call in plane with  the  horizon.  It is  a
difficult  thing  that  we  go to do, and we  do not want no
peoples tto watch us if so it may."
     Minaa took  a  growing  interest in everything and I was
rrejoiced to  see  that  the exigency of affairs  was helping
her  to  foorget  for a  time the terrible  experience of the
nigght. She was very, very pale, almost  ghastly, and so thin
that her lipss were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat
of prrominence.  I did not mention this last, lest  it should
give her needleess pain, but it made my blood run cold in  my
veins tto think of what had occurred with poor Lucy  when the
Count had sucked her blood.  As yet there was no sign of the
teeth groowing sharper,  but the time as  yet  was short, and
tthere was time for fear.
     When   we  came to the discussion of the sequence of our
effforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new
sources of dooubt. It was finally agreed that before starting
for PPiccadilly we should destroy the Count's lair  close  at
hand. In case hhe should find it out too soon, we should thus
be stilll ahead of him in our work of  destruction.  And  his
presence in his purely material shape, and  at  his weakest,
might givve us some new clue.
     A s to  thhe disposal of forces, it was suggested by the
Professsor  that,  after  our visit  to Carfax, we should all
enter the house in Piccadilly.  That  the  two doctors and I
should reemain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found
tthe lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.It was
possible, iif not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count
migght appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we
might be ablee to cope with him then and there. At  any rate,
we miight be  able to  follow him in force.  To  this plan  I
strenuously objjected, and so far as my going was  concerned,
for  I   said  that  I  intended to stay and protect Mina.  I
thought that my  mind was made up on the subject,  but  Mina
would nott listen to my objection.  She said that there might
bbe some law matter in which I could be useful.  That amongst
the  Count''s  papers might be some clue which I could under-
staand out of my experience in Transylvania.  And that, as it
was, all the  strength we could muster  was required  to cope
with  the Count's extraordinary power.  I had to give in, for
Mina's resolutiion was fixed.  She said that  it was the last
hope foor her that we should all work together.
     "As for  me," she  said,  "I  have no fear.  Things have
been  as bad as they  can  be.  And whatever  may happen must
have in it somee element of hope or comfort.  Go, my husband!
God cann, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any
one present."
      So I started up crying out,  "Then in God's name let us
come at oncee, for we are losing time.  The Count may come to
Picccadilly earlier than we think."
      "Not so!" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.
      "But why?"  I asked.
     "Do youu forget,"  he said, with actually a smile, "that
lastt night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?"
      Did I forget!   Shall I ever . . . can I ever!  Can any
of us ever fforget that  terrible scene!  Mina struggled hard
to kkeep her brave countenance, but the pain overmastered her
and she put heer hands before her face, and shuddered  whilst
she  mmoaned.   Van  Helsing  had  not intended to recall her
frightful experiience.  He had simply lost sight of  her  and
her partt in the affair in his intellectual effort.
     When  it struck him what he said,he was horrified at his
thhoughtlessness and tried to comfort her.
     "Oh, Maddam Mina," he said,"dear, dear, Madam Mina,alas!
That  I of all who so reverence you should have said anything
so forgetful.   These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid
old heaad do not deserve so, but you will forget it, will you
not?"  He bent low beside her as he spoke.
     She  took his hand, and looking at him through her tears,

said hoarsely,  "No, I shall not forget, for it is well that
I rememberr. And with it I have so much in memory of you that
iss sweet, that I take it all together.  Now, you must all be
going soon.   Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we
may  be strong."
      Breakfast was a strange meal to us all.  We tried to be
cheerful and enncourage each other,and Mina was the brightest
and mosst cheerful of us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood
up and said, "Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terr-
ible enteerprise.  Are we all armed, as we were on that night
wwhen first we visited our enemy's lair.Armed against ghostly
as well as  carnal attack?"
      We all assured him.
     "Then  it is well.  Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case
quiite safe here until the sunset.  And before then  we shall
return . . .  if . . .  We shall return! But before we go let
me seee you armed against personal attack.I have myself,since
you came down,pprepared your chamber by the placing of things
of whicch we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard
yourself.On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer
in the naame of the Father, the Son, and . . .
     There  was   a  fearful  scream  which  almost froze our
hearts tto hear.  As he had placed the Wafer on Mina's  fore-

head, it had seared it . . . had burned  into the  flesh  as
though it  had been a piece of whitehot metal.  My poor darl-
inng's  brain had  told  her  the significance of the fact as
quickly as hher nerves received the pain of it,and the two so
overrwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in
that dreadful  scream.
     But  the words to her thought came quickly.  The echo of
tthe scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came
the reactioon, and she sank on her knees on the floor  in  an
agoony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair over her face,
as the leperr of old his mantle, she wailed out.
     "Unclean! Unclean!  Even the Almighty shuns my polluted
flesh! I  must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until
tthe Judgement Day."
     They all paaused.  I had thrown myself beside her in  an
agony off helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her

tight.  For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together,
whilst thhe friends around us turned away their eyes that ran
ttears silently.  Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely.So
gravely  thhat  I could  not help feeling that he was in some
wayy inspired, and was stating things outside himself.
      "It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God
himself see  fit, as He most surely shall, on  the  Judgement
Day,, to redress all wrongs of the earth  and of His children
that He has pllaced thereon.  And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my
dear,  may we who love you be there to see,when that red scar,
the sign of Godd's knowledge of what has been,shall pass away,
and leeave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so
surely as we livve, that scar  shall pass  away when God sees
right too lift the burden that is hard upon us.  Till then we

bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will.  It
may be thaat we are chosen instruments  of His good pleasure,
annd that we ascend to  His  bidding  as  that other  through
stripes and  shame.  Through tears and blood.  Through doubts
and  fear, and all that  makes the difference between God and
man."
     ThThere  was  hope in  his  words, and comfort.  And they
made for  resignation.  Mina and  I both felt so, and simul-
taneouslyy we each took one of the old man's  hands and  bent
oover and kissed it.  Then without a word  we all  knelt down
together, aand  all holding hands, swore  to be true to  each
othher.  We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow
from the headd of her whom, each in his own way, we loved.And
we prrayed for help and  guidance in the terrible task  which
lay before us.  It was then time to start. So I said farewell
to Minaa, a parting which neither of us  shall  forget to our
dying day, and we set out.
     Too  one  thing  I have made up my mind.  If we find out
that Mina must be a vampire in  the end,  then she shall not
go into tthat unknown and terrible land alone.  I  suppose it
iis thus that in old times one  vampire meant many.  Just  as
their hideoous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the
holliest love was the recruiting sergeant  for  their ghastly
ranks.
       We  entered Carfax without trouble and found all things
the same as  onn the  first occasion.  It was hard to believe
that ammongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and
decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew.
Had not oour minds been made up, and had there not been terr-
iible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have  proceeded
with our taask. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the
houuse.  And in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as
we had seen tthem last.
     Drr. Van Helsing  said to us solemnly as we stood before
him,  "And now,  my friends,  we have a duty here to do.  We
must sterrilize this earth, so sacred of holy memories,  that
hhe has brought from a far distant land for such fell use. He
has chosen  this earth because it has been holy.  Thus we de-
feaat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still.
It was sancttified to such use of man, now we  sanctify it to
God.."
     As he  spooke  he took  from his bag a screwdriver and a
wrench,, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown
open.The earth smelled musty and close, but we did not some-
how seem  to mind, for our attention was concentrated  on the
PProfessor.  Taking from his box a piece of the  Scared Wafer
he laid it  reverently on the  earth,  and then shutting down
thee lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.
     One by onne we treated in the same way each of the great
boxes,, and left them as we had found them to all appearance.
But in each was  a portion of the Host.  When we  closed  the
door behhind us, the Professor  said  solemnly,  "So  much is

already done.  It may be  that with all the others we can be
so successsful, then  the sunset of this evening may shine of
Maadam Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!"
     As we ppassed  across the lawn on our way to the station
to ccatch our train we  could see the front of the asylum.  I
looked eagerlyy,  and  in the window of my own room saw Mina.
I  wavved  my  hand  to her, and nodded to tell that our work
there was successsfully accomplished.  She nodded in reply to
show thaat she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her

hand in farewell.  It was with a heavy heart that we  sought
the statioon and just caught the train, which was steaming in
ass we reached the platform.I have written this in the train.

     Piccacadilly,  12:30  o'clock.--Just  before  we  reached
Feenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to me,  "Quincey  and I
will find a  locksmith.  You had better not come  with  us in
casee there should be any difficulty.  For under the  circum-
stances  it woouldn't  seem  so  bad  for us to break into an
empty   house.  But you are a  solicitor and the Incorporated
Law  Society migght tell  you  that  you  should  have  known
better.""
     I  demurredd  as  to  my  not sharing any danger even of
odium, bbut he went on, "Besides, it will attract less atten-

tion if there are not too many of us.  My title will make it
all right  with the locksmith,and with any policeman that may
coome along.You had better go with Jack and the Professor and
stay in the  Green Park. Somewhere in sight of the house, and
whenn you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do
you all come aacross. We shall be on the lookout for you, and
shall  let you in."
      "The  advice is good!"  said Van Helsing, so we said no
more.Godalmingg and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following
in anoother. At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent
got out and stroolled into the Green Park. My heart beat as I
saw the  house on which so much of our hope was centered,loom-
ing up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its
more liveely and spruce-looking neighbors.   We sat down on a
bbench within good  view , and began to smoke cigars so as to
attract as  little attention as possible.  The minutes seemed
to  pass with  leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the
others.
       At  length  we saw a four-wheeler drive up.  Out of it,
in leisurely   fashion,  got  Lord Godalming and Morris.  And
down ffrom the box descended a thick-set working man with his
rush-woven  baskket  of  tools.  Morris  paid the cabman, who
touched  his hat and drove away.  Together  the  two ascended

the steps,and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.
The workmman took off his coat leisurely and hung it  on  one
oof the spikes of the rail, saying something  to  a policeman
who just  tthen sauntered along.  The policeman nodded acqui-
esccence,and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him.
After searchiing through it, he took out a selection of tools
whichh he proceeded to lay beside him in orderly fashion.Then
he stood up, loooked in the keyhole, blew into it,and turning
to his  employers, made some  remark.  Lord Godalming smiled,
and  the man lifted a good  sized bunch  of keys.  Selecting
one of thhem, he began  to probe  the lock, as if feeling his
wway with  it.  After fumbling about for a bit he tried a se-
cond, and tthen a third.  All at once the door opened under a
sliight push  from him, and he and the two others entered the
hall.  We satt still.  My  own cigar burnt furiously, but Van
Helsiing's  went cold altogether.  We  waited patiently as we
saw the workmann come out and bring his bag. Then he held the
door  ppartly open,  steadying it  with his knees,  whilst he
fitted  a  key  to the lock.  This he finally handed to Lord
Godalmingg, who took out his purse and gave him something.The
mman touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat  and  de-
parted.  Noot  a  soul took the slightest notice of the whole
traansaction.
     Whhen  the  man  had  fairly gone,  we three crossed the
street and knocked at the door.  It  was immediately  opened
by Quinceey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting
aa cigar.
     "Thee place  smells  so  vilely,"  said the latter as we
ccame in.  It did indeed smell vilely. Like the old chapel at
Carfax.  Annd with our previous experience it was plain to us
thaat  the  Count had been using the place pretty freely.  We
moved to expllore the house, all keeping together in  case of
attacck, for we knew we had a strong and wily  enemy to  deal
with, and as yeet we did not know whether the Count might not
be in tthe house.
     Inn the dining room,  which lay at the back of the hall,
we found eight boxes  of earth.  Eight boxes only out of the
nine whicch we sought! Our work was not over, and would never
bbe until we should have found the missing box.
     Fiirst we opened the shutters of the window which looked
out across a narrow stone flagged yard at the blank face  of
a  stablee,  pointed to  look  like  the front of a miniature
hhouse.  There were no windows in it,  so  we were not afraid
of being ovverlooked.  We did not lose any time  in examining
thee chests.  With the tools which we had brought with  us we
opened them,  one by one, and treated them as  we had treated
thosee others in the old chapel.  It was evident to  us  that
the Count was nnot at present in the house,  and we proceeded
to searrch for any of his effects.
     Aftter a cursory glance at  the  rest of the rooms, from

basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining
room contaained  any effects which might belong to the Count.
Annd so we proceeded to minutely examine them.  They lay in a
sort of ordeerly disorder on the great dining room table.
     Theere  were  title  deeds  of the Piccadilly house in a

great bundle, deeds  of the  purchase  of the houses at Mile
End and  BBermondsey, notepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink.
Alll were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from
the dust. Thhere were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb,
and  a jug and basin. The latter containing dirty water which
was reddened aas if with blood. Last of all was a little heap
of keyys of all sorts and sizes,  probably those belonging to
the other housess.
     When we haad examined this last find, Lord Godalming and
Quinceyy  Morris  taking  accurate  notes of the various add-
resses of  the houses  in  the East and the South, took with
them  thee keys in  a great bunch, and set out to destroy the
bboxes in these places.The rest of us are, with what patience
we can, waiiting their return, or the coming of the Count.

CHAPTER 23

                      DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


     3 October.--The time seemed teribly long whilst we were
waiting foor the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris.  The
Prrofessor  tried  to keep our minds active by using them all
the time.  II  could see  his beneficent purpose, by the side
glannces which he  threw from time  to  time  at Harker.  The
poor fellow iss overwhelmed in  a misery that is appalling to
see.   Last night  he  was  a  frank, happy-looking man, with
strong,  youthfuul face, full of  energy, and with dark brown
hair.  TToday  he  is  a  drawn, haggard old man, whose white

hair  matches well  with the  hollow burning eyes and grief-
written liines of his face.  His  energy is still intact.  In
faact,  he  is like a living flame.  This may yet be his sal-
vation, for  if all  go  well, it will tide him over the des-
pairring period.  He will then, in  a kind of way, wake again
to  the realitties  o f life.  Poor fellow,  I thought my own
troublle was bad enough, but his . . .!
      The Professor knows  this well enough, and is doing his
best to keepp his mind active.  What he  has been saying was,
undeer the circumstances, of absorbing interest.  So  well as
I can rememberr, here it is:
      "I have studied,  over  and  over again since they came
into my handss, all the papers relating to  this monster, and
the mmore I have studied, the greater  seems the necessity to
utterly stamp hhim out.  All through there  are  signs of his
advancee.  Not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it.
As  I  learned  from the researches of my friend Arminius of
Buda-Pestth,  he was  in life a most wonderful man.  Soldier,
sstatesman,  and alchemist.  Which  latter  was  the  highest
developmentt of the science knowledge of his time.  He  had a
migghty  brain, a  learning beyond  compare, and a heart that
knew no fear  and no  remorse.  He dared  even  to attend the
Schollomance,  and there  was no  branch of knowledge  of his
time that he diid not essay.
      "Well, in  him  the brain  powers survived the physical
death. Though  it would seem that memory was not all complete.
In soome faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child.
But he is growiing, and some things that were childish at the
first aare now  of  man's stature.  He  is experimenting, and
doing it well.  And if it had not been that  we have crossed
his  pathh  he would be yet,  he  may  be yet if we fail, the
ffather or furtherer of a new order of beings,whose road must
lead througgh Death, not Life."
     Harker grooaned and  said,  "And  this  is  all  arrayed
againstt my darling!  But how is he experimenting?  The know-
ledge may help us to defeat him!"

     "He  has all along, since  his coming,  been trying his
power, sloowly but  surely.  That big child-brain  of  his is
woorking.  Well for us, it is as yet, a child-brain.  For had
he dared, att the first, to attempt certain  things  he would
longg ago have been beyond our power.  However,  he means  to
succeed, and aa man who has centuries before  him can  afford
to waiit and to go slow.Festina lente may well be his motto."
     "I fail to  understand," said  Harker  wearily.  "Oh, do
be more  plain to me!  Perhaps grief and  trouble are dulling

my brain."
     TThe Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as
he spoke,  "Ah,  my child, I will be plain.  Do you  not  see
how, of  late, this monster has  been creeping into knowledge

experimentally. How he has been making use of the zoophagous
patient too effect his entry into friend John's home.For your
Vaampire,though in all afterwards he can come when and how he
will, must aat the first make  entry only when asked  thereto
by   an inmate.  But these are not his most important experi-
ments.  Do  wee not see  how at the first  all these so great
boxes  were moved by others.   He knew not then but that must
be so. But all tthe time that so great child-brain of his was
growing,, and he began  to consider whether he might not him-

self  move the box.  So he began to help.  And then, when he
found thatt this be all right, he try to move them all alone.
Annd so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him.  And
none but he  know where they are hidden.
     "HHe may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So
that only he use them in the night, or at such  time  as  he
can  channge his  form, they do  him equal well, and none may
kknow these are his hiding place!  But, my child, do not des-
pair, this  knowledge came to him just too late!  Already all
of  his lairs but one be sterilize as for him. And before the
sunset this sshall be so.  Then he have no place where he can
move  and hide.  I delayed this morning that  so we  might be
sure.  Is theree not more at stake for us than for him?  Then
why nott be more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour
and already, if all be well,friend Arthur and Quincey are on
their wayy to us.  Today is our  day, and we must go sure, if
sslow, and lose no chance.  See!  There  are five of us  when
those absennt ones return."
      Whilst we  were speaking we were startled by a knock at
the hall  ddoor, the double  postman's knock of the telegraph
boyy.  We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van
Helsing, holdding up his hand to us to  keep silence, stepped
to  tthe door and opened it.  The boy handed in  a  dispatch.
The Professor cclosed the door again,and after looking at the
directiion, opened it and read aloud.
      "Look out  for  D.  He  has  just now, 12:45, come from
Carfax hurriedlly and hastened towards the South. He seems to
be goinng the round and may want to see you:  Mina."
     Theere  was  a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice,

"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!"
     Van HHelsing  turned to him quickly and said,  "God will
acct in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
as yet.  Forr  what we wish  for at the moment may be our own
undooings."
     "I caare for nothing now," he answered hotly, "except to
wiipe out this brute from the face of creation.  I would sell
my soul to ddo it!"
     "Oh,  hush, hush, my child!" said Van Helsing. "God does
noot purchase souls in this wise, and the Devil,though he may
purchase, dooes not keep faith.  But God is merciful and just,
andd  knows  your  pain and  your devotion to that dear Madam
Mina.  Think  you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but
hear  your wild words.  Do not fear any of us, we are all de-
voted to this ccause, and today shall  see the end.  The time
is comiing for action.  Today  this  Vampire is  limit to the
powers of man, and till sunset he may  not  change.  It will
take him  time to arrive here, see  it is twenty minutes past
oone, and there are yet some times before he can hither come,
be he neverr so quick.  What we must hope for is that my Lord
Artthur and Quincey arrive first."
      About half an hour  after we had received Mrs. Harker's
telegram,  theere  came a quiet,  resolute  knock at the hall
door.  It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly
by thousands of  gentlemen, but it made the Professor's heart
and minee beat loudly.  We looked at each other, and together

moved out into the hall.  We each held ready to use our var-
ious armamments, the spiritual in the  left  hand, the mortal
inn the right. Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and holding
the door hallf open, stood back, having both  hands ready for
actiion.  The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our
faces when on  the step,close to the door, we saw Lord Godal-
ming aand Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed the
door behind themm, the former saying, as they moved along the
hall.
 
     "It is all right.  We  found both places.  Six boxes in
each and wee destroyed them all."
     "Destroyyed?" asked the Professor.
     "Forr him!" We were silent for a minute,and then Quincey
ssaid,  "There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however,
he doesn't  turn up by five o'clock, we must start  off.  For
it  won't do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset."
      "He will  be  here  before long now,' said Van Helsing,
who  had beeen  consulting  his  pocketbook.  "Nota bene,  in
Madaam's telegram he went south from Carfax.  That  means  he
went to cross  the river, and he could only do so at slack of
tide,  which should be something before one o'clock.  That he
went south has aa meaning for us.  He is  as yet  only suspi-
cious, aand he went  from Carfax  first to the place where he

would suspect interference least. You must have been at Ber-
mondsey onnly a short time before him.  That he is  not  here
allready shows that he went to  Mile End next.  This took him
some time, ffor he would  then have  to be carried  over  the
riveer in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have
long to wait nnow.  We should have ready some plan of attack,
so thaat we may throw away no chance.  Hush, there is no time
now.  Have all yyour arms!  Be ready!"  He held  up a warning
hand as  he spoke,for we all could hear a key softly inserted

in the lock of the hall door.
      I could  not but admire, even at such a moment, the way
in which a domiinant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunt-
ing parrties and adventures in different parts of the  world,
Quincey Morris had always been the one to  arrange  the plan
of actionn, and Arthur and I had been accustomed  to obey him
iimplicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinc-
tively.  Wiith a swift glance around the room,he at once laid
outt our plan of attack, and without speaking  a word, with a
gesture, placced us  each in position.  Van Helsing,  Harker,
and II were just behind the door, so that  when it was opened
the Professor ccould guard it whilst we two  stepped  between
the inccomer and the door.  Godalming  behind and  Quincey in
front stood just out of sight ready to  move in front of the
window.   We waited in a suspense that made  the seconds pass
wwith nightmare slowness.  The slow, careful steps came along
the hall. TThe Count was evidently prepared for some surprise,
att least he feared it.
     Suddenly   with  a single  bound he leaped into the room.
Winniing  a  way past us before  any of us could raise a hand
to  stay him.   There was  something  so  pantherlike  in the
movemennt, something so unhuman, that it  seemed to  sober us
all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was Hark-
er, who wwith a quick movement,threw  himself before the door
lleading  into the room in the front  of the  house.  As  the
Count saw uus, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face,
shoowing the eyeteeth long and  pointed.  But the  evil smile
as quickly paassed into  a  cold stare  of lion-like disdain.
His eexpression again  changed as, with a single  impulse, we
all advanced uppon  him.  It was a pity that  we had not some
better  organized plan  of attack, for  even at the moment  I
wondered what we were  to do.  I did not myself know whether
our lethaal weapons would avail us anything.

     Harker evidently  meant  to try  the matter, for he had
ready his   great Kukri knife and  made  a  fierce and sudden
cuut at him.  The blow was a powerful one.  Only  the diabol-
ical quickneess of the Count's leap back saved him.  A second
lesss and the trenchant blade had  shorn  through  his  coat,
making  a  widde  gap  whence a  bundle of  bank notes and  a
streamm of gold fell out. The expression of the Count's  face
was so hellish,tthat for a moment I feared for Harker, though
I saw hiim throw the terrible knife aloft again  for  another

stroke.  Instinctively I moved  forward  with  a  protective
impulse, hholding the Crucifix and  Wafer in my left hand.  I
feelt a mighty power fly  along my arm, and  it  was  without
surprise thaat I saw the monster cower back before  a similar
moveement made spontaneously by each one of us.  It would  be
impossible to  describe the expression  of  hate and  baffled
malignnity, of anger and hellish rage,  which  came over  the
Count's face.  HHis waxen hue  became greenish-yellow  by the
contrastt of his burning eyes, and the red scar on  the fore-

head showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The
next instaant, with a sinuous dive  he swept  under  Harker's
arrm, ere his blow could fall, and grasping a handful of  the
money from tthe floor, dashed across the room, threw  himself
at tthe window.  Amid the  crash  and  glitter of the falling
glass, he tumbbled into the flagged area below.  Through  the
sound  of the shivering glass I could  hear the "ting" of the
gold, as some off the  sovereigns fell on the flagging.
     We ran ovver and saw him spring  unhurt from the ground.
He, ruushing up  the  steps,  crossed  the  flagged yard, and
pushed open the  stable door.  There he  turned  and spoke to
us.
       "You  think  to baffle me, you with your pale faces all
in a row, likke  sheep  in  a butcher's.  You shall be  sorry
yet,  each one of you!  You think you have left me without  a
place to rest,  but I have more.  My revenge  is just  begun!
I spreaad it over  centuries, and time is  on my  side.  Your
girls that you all love  are mine already.  And through them
you and   others shall yet be mine, my  creatures, to  do  my
bbidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed.  Bah!"
     With  a  ccontemptuous sneer, he  passed quickly through
the dooor, and we  heard the rusty bolt  creak as he fastened
it behind him.  A door beyond opened and shut.  The first of
us to speeak was the Professor.  Realizing  the difficulty of
ffollowing him through the stable, we  moved toward the hall.
     "We haave learnt something . . . much!   Notwithstanding
hiss brave words, he fears us.  He fears time, he fears want!
For if not, wwhy he hurry so?  His  very tone betray  him, or
my eaars deceive.  Why  take  that money?  You  follow quick.
You are hunterss of the wild beast,  and  understand  it  so.
For me,, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to  him,
if so that he returns."
     As hee spoke  he put  the money remaining in his pocket,
toook the title deeds in the  bundle as Harker had left them,
and  swept   the  remaining  things into  the open fireplace,
wherre he set fire to them with a match.
     Godalming  and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and
Harker  hhad  lowered  himself from  the window to follow the
CCount.  He had, however, bolted  the stable door, and by the
time they hhad forced it open there  was no sign of him.  Van
Hellsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house.
But the mewss was deserted and no one had seen him depart.
     Itt was now late in the afternoon,and sunset was not far
off.  We had to recognize that our game was up.  With  heavy
hearts wee agreed with the Professor when he said, "Let us go
bback to Madam Mina.  Poor, poor dear Madam Mina.  All we can
do just noww is done, and we can there, at least, protect her.
Buut we need not despair.There is but one more earth box, and
we must try  to find it.When that is done all may yet be well."
      I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to com-
fort Harkerr.  The poor fellow was quite broken down, now and
agaain he gave a low groan which he could not suppress.He was
thinking of hhis wife.
     Witth  sad hearts  we came  back to  my  house, where we

found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerful-
ness whicch did honor to her bravery and unselfishness.  When
sshe saw our faces, her own became as pale  as death.  For  a
second or ttwo her eyes were closed as if she were  in secret
praayer.
     And  thhen  she said cheerfully,  "I can never thank you
all  enough.  Oh, my poor darling!"
      As  she spoke, she took  her husband's grey head in her
hands and kisssed it.
     "Lay  your poor  head here and rest it.  All will yet be
weell, dear!  God  will  protect  us  if He so will it in His
good intent.."  The poor fellow groaned.  There  was no place
for  words in his sublime misery.
     WWe  had  a  sort  of perfunctory supper together, and I
think it cheeredd us all  up  somewhat.  It was, perhaps, the
mere aniimal heat of food to hungry  people,  for  none of us

had eaten anything since breakfast,or the sense of companion-
ship  mayy  have  helped  us,  but  anyhow  we  were all less
mmiserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope.
     True  to our promise,  we told  Mrs.  Harker  everything
whhich had passed. And although she grew snowy white at times
when danger  had seemed to threaten her husband, and  red  at
otheers when his devotion to her was  manifested she listened
bravely and wiith calmness.  When we came to the  part  where
Harkerr had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she  clung  to
her husband's arrm, and held it tight as  though her clinging
could prrotect him from any harm that might  come.  She  said

nothing, however,till the narration was all done,and matters
had been bbrought up to the present time.
      Then without letting go her husband's hand she stood up
amongst us andd spoke.  Oh, that I could give any idea of the
scene.. Of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the rad-
iant beauty of  her youth and animation, with the red scar on
her forrehead, of which she was conscious, and  which we  saw
with grinding  of our teeth,  remembering whence and  how it
came.  Heer loving kindness against our grim hate. Her tender
ffaith against all our fears and doubting.  And  we,  knowing
that so farr as symbols went, she with  all her goodness  and
purrity and faith, was outcast from God.
     "Jonathan,""  she said,  and the word sounded like music
on her llips it was so full of love and tenderness, "Jonathan

dear, and you all my true, true friends, I want you to  bear
something  in mind through all this dreadful time.I know that
yoou must fight.  That you must destroy even as you destroyed
the false Luucy so that the true Lucy might  live  hereafter.
But  it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought
all this miserry is the saddest case of all.  Just think what
will bbe his joy when he, too,is destroyed in his worser part
that his better  part may have spiritual immortality.You must
be pitifful to him,too,though it may not hold your hands from

his destruction."
     As she spoke I could see her husband's face  darken and
draw togeether, as though the passion in  him were shriveling
hhis being to its core. Instinctively the clasp on his wife's
hand grew ccloser, till his knuckles  looked white.  She  did
nott flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered,
but looked aat him with eyes that were  more  appealing  than
everr.
     As she stoopped  speaking he leaped  to his feet, almost
tearingg his hand from hers as he spoke.
      "May God give him into my hand  just for long enough to
destroy thatt earthly life of him which we are aiming at.  If
beyoond it I could send his soul forever and ever to  burning
hell I would ddo it!"
     "Oh,  hush! Oh, hush in the name of the good God.  Don't
saay such things,  Jonathan, my husband, or you will crush me
with fear annd horror.  Just think, my dear . . . I have been
thinnking  all this long,  long  day  of  it . . . that . . .
perhaps . . .ssome day  . . . I, too, may need such pity, and
that ssome other like you, and with equal cause for anger,may
deny it to me!   Oh, my husband!  My husband, indeed I  would
have spaared you such a thought had there been  another  way.

But I pray that God may not have treasured your  wild words,
except as  the heart-broken wail of a  very loving and sorely
sttricken man.  Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in ev-
idence of whhat he has suffered, who all his life has done no
wronng, and on whom so many sorrows have come."
     We  mmen were  all in tears now.  There was no resisting
thhem, and  we  wept openly.  She  wept, too, to see that her
sweeter  couunsels had prevailed.  Her husband  flung himself
on hhis knees beside her, and putting his arms round her, hid
his face in thhe folds of her dress.  Van Helsing beckoned to
us andd we  stole out  of  the room, leaving the  two  loving
hearts alone witth their God.
      Before  they  retired  the  Professor fixed up the room
against any cooming of the Vampire,  and  assured Mrs. Harker
that sshe might rest in peace.  She tried to  school  herself
to the belief, aand manifestly for her husband's sake,  tried
to seem  content.  It was a brave struggle,  and was, I think

and believe, not without its reward.  Van Helsing had placed
at hand a  bell which either of them was to sound  in case of
anny emergency.   When they  had retired, Quincey, Godalming,
and I arrangged that we should  sit up,  dividing  the  night
betwween us, and watch over the safety of the  poor  stricken
lady.  The firrst watch falls to Quincey, so the  rest  of us
shall  be off to bed as soon as we can.
      Godalming has already turned in,  for his is the second
watch.  Now  that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.

         JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

       3-4 October, close to  midnight.--I  thought  yesterday
would never endd.  There was over me a yearning for sleep, in
some  ssort  of  blind  belief  that to wake would be to find
things  changed,  and that  any  change  must now be for the
better.   Before we parted, we discussed what  our next  step
wwas to be, but we could arrive at  no  result.  All we  knew
was that  oone earth box  remained, and that  the Count alone
kneew where it was.If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle
us for years..  And in the meantime, the thought is too horr-
ible,, I dare not think of it even now.  This I know, that if
ever there was  a woman who was all perfection,that one is my
poor wrronged darling.  I loved her a thousand times more for
her sweet pity of last night,a pity that made my own hate of
the monstter seem despicable.  Surely God will not permit the
wworld to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature.  This
is hope to  me.  We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith
is  our only anchor.Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping
without dreamms.  I fear what her dreams  might be like, with
such  terrible memories to  ground them in.  She has not been
so calm,  withiin  my  seeing, since the sunset.  Then, for a
while,   there  came  over  her  face a repose which was like
spring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that
it was thhe softness of the red sunset on her face, but some-
hhow  now  I  think it has a deeper meaning.  I am not sleepy
myself, thoough I am weary . . . weary to death.  However,  I
musst try to sleep.  For there is tomorrow to think  of,  and
there is no rrest for me until . . .

     Laterer--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awakened by
Miina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her
face.  I couuld see easily, for we did not leave the  room in
darkkness.  She had placed a warning hand over my mouth,  and
now she whispeered in my ear, "Hush!  There is someone in the
corriddor!"  I got up softly, and crossing  the room,  gently
opened the door..
     Just  outsiide, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris,
wide awaake.  He raised a warning hand for silence as he whis-
pered to me,  "Hush!  Go back to bed.  It is all right.  One
of us willl be here all night.  We don't  mean  to  take  any
cchances!"
     Hiss look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back

and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile
stole overr her poor, pale face as she put her arms  round me
annd said softly,  "Oh, thank God for good brave men!" With a
sigh she sannk back again to sleep.  I write this now as I am
not  sleepy, though I must try again.


     4 October, morning.--Once again during the night I  was
wakened byy Mina.  This time we had all had a good sleep, for
thhe  grey  of  the  coming  dawn was making the windows into
sharp oblonggs,and the gas flame was like a speck rather than
a diisc of light.
      She said to me hurriedly,  "Go, call the  Professor.  I
want to see hiim at once."
      "Why?" I asked.
      "I  have  an  idea.  I suppose it must have come in the
night, and  matured without my knowing it.  He must hypnotize
me  before the dawn, and then I shall be able  to  speak.  Go
quick, dearesst, the time is getting close."
      I went to the door.  Dr. Seward was resting on the matt-
ress, and seeeing me, he sprang to his feet.
      "Is anything wrong?" he asked, in alarm.
     "No,"  I replied. "But Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing
at  once."
     "I wiill go,"  he said, and hurried into the Professor's
rooom.
     Two  or  three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room
in hiis dressing gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were
with Dr. Sewardd at the door asking questions.  When the Pro-
fessor  saw Mina a smile, a positive smile ousted the anxiety
of his face.
      He  rubbed  his  hands  as he said,  "Oh, my dear Madam
Mina, this  iis  indeed  a change.  See!  Friend Jonathan, we
have  got our dear Madam Mina,  as of old, back to us today!"
Then turning too her, he said cheerfully,  "And what am I  to
do for  you? For at this hour you do not want me for nothing."
     "I want  yoou to hypnotize me!" she said.  "Do it before
the dawnn,  for I feel that then I can speak, and speak free-

ly.  Be  quick,  for the time is short!"  Without a word  he
motioned hher to sit up in bed.
     Looking ffixedly at her, he commenced to make passes  in
front   of her, from over the  top of her head downward, with
each hand in turrn.  Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few min-
utes, duuring which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for

I felt that some  crisis was  at hand.  Gradually  her  eyes
closed, annd she sat, stock still. Only by the gentle heaving
off her bosom could one know that she was alive.The Professor
made a few mmore passes and then stopped,and I could see that
his  forehead was covered with  great  beads of perspiration.
Mina opened heer eyes,  but  she did not seem the same woman.
There  was a far-away look  in her  eyes, and her voice had a
sad dreaminess wwhich was new to me.  Raising his hand to im-
pose  siilence, the  Professor motioned to  me to  bring  the

others in.They came on tiptoe, closing the door behind them,
and stood  at the foot of the bed, looking on.  Mina appeared
noot to see them.  The stillness was broken by Van  Helsing's
voice speakiing in a low level tone which would not break the
currrent of her thoughts.
     "Where arre you?"  The answer came in a neutral way.
     "I doo not know.Sleep has no place it can call its own."
Foor several minutes there was silence.  Mina sat  rigid, and
the Professoor stood staring at her fixedly.
      The rest  of us  hardly dared to breathe.  The room was
growing lightter.  Without  taking his eyes from Mina's face,
Dr. VVan Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind.  I did so,
and the day seeemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a
rosy liight seemed to diffuse itself through the room. On the
instant the Professor spoke again.
     "Where are you now?"
     Thee answer  came dreamily, but with intention.  It were

as though she were interpreting something.  I have heard her
use the saame tone when reading her shorthand notes.
     "I do  not know.  It is all strange to me!"
     "What do yoou see?"
     "I ccan see nothing.  It is all dark."
      "What do  you  hear?"  I could detect the strain in the
Professor'ss patient voice.
      "The lapping of  water.  It is gurgling  by, and little
waves leap..  I can hear them on the outside."

     "Then you are on a ship?'"
      We all looked at each  other, trying to glean something
each from thee other.  We were afraid to think.
      The answer came quick,  "Oh, yes!"
     "What elsse do you hear?"
      "The sound  of men stamping overhead as they run about.
There is thhe creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the
cheeck of the capstan falls into the ratchet."
     "Whatt are you doing?"

     "I am still,oh so still.  It is like death!"  The voice
faded awayy into a  deep  breath as  of one sleeping, and the
oppen eyes closed again.
     By this  time the sun  had risen, and we were all in the
full  light of day.Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's
shoulders, and  laid her head down softly on her pillow.  She
lay likke a sleeping child for a few moments, and  then, with
a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around
her.
       "Have I been talking in my sleep?" was all she said.She
seemed,howeveer, to know the situation without telling,though
she   was eager to know what she had told.  The Professor re-
peated the convversation, and she said,  "Then there is not a
moment  to lose.  It may not be yet too late!"
     Mr. Morriis and Lord Godalming started for the door  but
the Prrofessor's calm voice called them back.
     "Stay,  mmy  friends.  That  ship, wherever  it was, was
weighiing  anchor at the moment in your so great Port of Lon-
don.  Which of tthem is it that you seek? God be thanked that
we have  once again a clue, though whither it may lead us  we

know  not.  We have  been  blind somewhat.  Blind  after the
manner of  men, since we can look back  we see what we  might
haave seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we
might have sseen!  Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it
not??  We can know now what was in the Count's mind,  when he
seize that monney, though Jonathan's so fierce  knife put him
in thee danger that even he dread.  He meant escape. Hear me,
ESCAPE!  He saw  that with but one earth box left, and a pack
of men ffollowing like dogs after a  fox,  this London was no

place for him.  He have take his last  earth  box on board a
ship, and  he leave the land.  He think to escape, but no! We
foollow him.  Tally Ho!  As friend  Arthur  would say when he
put on his rred frock!  Our  old  fox is wily.  Oh!  So wily,
and  we must follow with wile.  I, too,  am wily  and I think
his mind in a  little  while.  In meantime we may rest and in
peace,, for there are between us which he do not want to pass,
and which he coould not if he would.  Unless the ship were to
touch tthe land, and then only at full or slack tide.See, and
the sun is just  rose,  and all day to sunset is us.  Let us
take bathh, and  dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
aand which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same
land with uus."
     Mina loooked at him appealingly as she asked,  "But  why
need  we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?"
      He took her hand and patted it as he replied,  "Ask  me
nothing as  yet.  When we have breakfast, then  I answer  all
queestions."  He would say no more, and we separated to dress.
     After bbreakfast Mina repeated her question.  He  looked
at hher gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully,  "Be-
cause my dear,, dear Madam Mina, now more than  ever  must we
find hhim even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!"
     She grew paaler as she asked faintly,  "Why?"
      "Because," he answered solemnly, "he can  live for cen-
turies, andd you are but mortal woman.  Time  is  now  to  be
dreeaded, since once he put that mark upon your throat."

     I was just in time to catch her as she fell  forward in
a faint.

     This to Jonnathan Harker.
      You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina.  We shall go
to make our ssearch, if I can call it so,for it is not search
but kknowing, and we seek confirmation only.  But do you stay
and take care oof her today.  This is your best and most hol-
iest offfice.  This day nothing can find him here.
     Let mme tell you that so you will know what we four know
allready, for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away.
He have gonne back to his Castle in Transylvania.I know it so
welll, as if a great hand of fire wrote  it on  the wall.  He
have prepare  for this in some way, and that  last  earth box
was rready to ship somewheres.For this he took the money. For
this he hurry aat the last, lest we  catch him before the sun
go downn.It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the
tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he  thought like
him, keepp open to him.  But there was not of time. When that
ffail he make straight for his last resource, his last earth-
work I mighht say did I wish double entente. He is clever, oh
so  clever! He know that his game here was finish.  And so he
decide he go  back  home.  He find ship going by the route he
came,, and he go in it.
     We  go  off  now to find  what ship, and whither bound.
When we hhave discover that,  we  come back and tell you all.
TThen we will comfort you and poor  Madam Mina with new hope.
For it willl be hope when you think it  over, that all is not
losst.  This very creature  that  we pursue, he take hundreds
of years to gget so  far as London.  And yet in one day, when
we knnow of the  disposal  of  him we  drive him  out.  He is
finite, though  he is powerful to do much  harm  and  suffers
not as  we do.  But we are strong, each  in  our purpose, and
we are all more strong  together.  Take heart  afresh,  dear
husband oof Madam Mina.  This battle is but begun  and in the
eend we shall win.  So sure as that God sits on high to watch
over  His   children.  Therefore  be  of much comfort till we
retturn.

         JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

     4 4 October.--When I read to Mina,  Van Helsing's message
in the phonograpph, the poor girl brightened up considerably.
Already   the  certainty that the Count is out of the country

has given her comfort.  And comfort is strength to her.  For
my own parrt,now that his horrible danger is not face to face
wiith us, it seems almost impossible to believe in it.Even my
own terriblee experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a  long
forggotten dream.  Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
sunlight.
       Alas! How can I disbelieve!  In the midst of my thought
my eye fell oon the red scar on my poor darling's white fore-
head..  Whilst  that  lasts, there can be no disbelief.  Mina
and I fear to bbe idle,  so we have been over all the diaries
again aand again.  Somehow, although the reality seem greater
each time, the pain and  the fear seem less.  There is some-
thing  off a  guiding  purpose  manifest throughout, which is
ccomforting.  Mina says that perhaps  we are  the instruments
of ultimatee good.  It may be!  I shall try to  think  as she
doees.  We have never spoken to each other yet of the future.
It is better  to  wait till we  see  the  Professor  and  the
otherrs after their investigations.
      The day is  running by more quickly than I ever thought
a day could runn for me again.  It is now three o'clock.

         M MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

     5 Octobober, 5 p.m.--Our  meeting  for  report.  Present:
Proffessor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward,Mr.Quincey
Morris, Jonathhan Harker, Mina Harker.
     Dr. Vaan  Helsing described what steps were taken during
thee  day to  discover on  what boat  and whither bound Count
Dracula made  his escape.
      "As I knew that  he wanted to get back to Transylvania,
I felt sure thaat he must go by the Danube mouth, or by some-
where iin the Black Sea, since by that way he come.  It was a
dreary blank that was before us.  Omme Ignotum pro magnifico.
And so wwith heavy hearts we start to find what  ships  leave

for the Black Sea last night.  He was in sailing ship, since
Madam Minaa tell of sails being set.  These not so  important
ass to go in your list of the shipping in the Times,and so we
go, by suggeestion of Lord Godalming, to your  Lloyd's, where
are  note of all ships that sail, however so small.  There we
find that onlyy one Black Sea bound ship go out with the tide.
She iis the Czarina Catherine, and she  sail from Doolittle's
Wharf for Varnaa, and thence to other ports and up the Danube.
`So!'  said I, `this is the ship  whereon  is the Count.'  So
off we go to Dooolittle's Wharf,and there we find a man in an
office.   From him we inquire  o f the  goings of the Czarina

Catherine.  He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice,
but he goood fellow all  the same.  And when Quincey give him
ssomething from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up,and
put it in aa so small bag which he have hid deep in his cloth-
inng, he still better fellow and humble servant to us.He come
with us, andd ask  many  men who are rough and hot.  These be
bettter fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They
say much of bllood and bloom,and of others which I comprehend
not,   though I  guess what they mean.  But nevertheless they
tell us all thinngs which we want to know.
     "Theey make known  to  us among them, how last afternoon
aat about five o'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin
and pale, wwith high nose and teeth  so white, and eyes  that
seeem to be burning.  That he be all in black, except that he
have a hat off straw which suit not him or the time.  That he
scattter his money in making quick  inquiry as to  what  ship
sails for the BBlack Sea and for where.  Some took him to the
office  and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but
halt at shore end of gangplank,and ask that the captain come
to him. TThe captain come, when told that he will be pay well,

and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then
the thin mman go and some one tell  him where  horse and cart
caan be hired.  He go there and  soon  he come again, himself
driving cartt on which a great box. This he himself lift down,
thoough it take several  to put it on truck for the ship.  He
give much tallk to  captain as to how and where his box is to
be pllace.  But the captain like  it  not and swear at him in
many tongues, aand tell  him  that if he like he can come and
see wheere it shall be. But he say `no,' that he come not yet,
for that he havee much to do.  Whereupon the captain tell him
that  hee had  better be quick, with blood, for that his ship

will leave the place, of  blood, before the turn of the tide,
with bloood.  Then  the thin man smile and say that of course
hhe must go when he think  fit, but he will be surprise if he
go quite soo soon.  The  captain  swear  again, polyglot, and
thee thin man make him bow, and thank  him,  and say  that he
will so far iintrude on his kindness as to come aboard before
the ssailing.  Final the captain, more red than ever, and  in
more tongues, ttell him that he doesn't  want  no  Frenchmen,
with blloom upon them and also with blood, in his ship,  with
blood on her also.  And so, after asking where he might pur-
chase shiip forms, he departed.
     "No one  knew where  he went `or bloomin' well cared' as
they  said, for they had something else to think of,well with
blood again.  FFor it soon became apparent to  all  that  the
Czarinaa Catherine would not sail as was expected.A thin mist
began to creep up from the river, and it grew,and grew. Till
soon a deense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.  The
ccaptain swore polyglot, very polyglot, polyglot  with  bloom
and blood,  but he could do nothing.  The water rose and rose,
annd he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether.
He was in noo friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin
man  came up the gangplank again and  asked  to see where his
box had been sstowed. Then the captain replied that he wished
that hhe and his box, old and with much bloom and blood, were
in hell.  But thhe thin man did  not be offend, and went down
with thee mate and saw where  it was place,  and  came up and

stood awhile on deck in fog.He must have come off by himself,
for none  notice him.Indeed they thought not of him, for soon
tthe fog begin  to  melt  away,  and all was clear again.  My
friends of  the thirst and the language that was of bloom and
bloood laughed,as they told how the captain's swears exceeded
even his usuaal polyglot, and was more than ever full of pic-
turessque, when on  questioning  other mariners  who were  on
movement up andd down  the river that hour, he found that few
of themm had seen any of fog at all,except where it lay round
the wharf.  However, the  ship went out on the ebb tide, and
was doubttless by morning far down  the river mouth.  She was
tthen, when they told us, well out to sea.
     "And soo, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest
for  a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his
command, on hiis way to the Danube mouth.To sail a ship takes
time,  go she never so quick. And when we start to go on land
more quick, and  we meet him there.  Our best hope is to come
on him wwhen in the box between sunrise and sunset.  For then

he  can  make  no struggle,  and  we may deal with him as we
should.Theere are days for us, in which we can make ready our
pllan.  We know all about where he go.  For  we have seen the
owner of thee ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers
thatt can be.  The box we seek is to  be landed in Varna, and
to be given too an agent, one  Ristics who will there present
his crredentials.  And so our merchant friend  will have done
his part. When hhe ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he
can teleegraph and have inquiry made  at  Varna, we say `no,'

for what is to be done is  not for police or of the customs.
It must bee done by us alone and in our own way."
     When Dr.  Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him  if
he werre  certain that  the  Count had remained on board  the
ship.  He replieed,  "We have the best proof of that,your own
evidencee, when in the hypnotic trance this morning."
     I aasked him again if it were really necessary that they

should pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me,
and I knoow that he would surely go if the  others went.   He
aanswered in growing passion, at first quietly. As he went on,
however, hhe grew more  angry and  more forceful, till in the
ennd we could not but see wherein was  at  least some of that
personal domminance which made  him so long  a master amongst
men..
     "Yes, it iss  necessary, necessary, necessary!  For your
sake in  the first, and  then for the sake of humanity.  This

monster has done  much harm  already,  in  the  narrow scope
where he ffind himself, and in the short time  when as yet he
waas only as  a body groping his so small measure in darkness
and not knowwing.  All this have I told these others.  You,my
dearr Madam Mina,will learn it in the phonograph of my friend
John, or in thhat of your husband.  I have told them how  the
measurre of leaving his own barren land,barren of peoples,and
coming to a new  land where life of man teems  till  they are
like  thhe  multitude of  standing corn, was the work of cen-

turies.  Were  another of the Undead, like him, to try to do
what he haas done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world
thhat have been, or that will be, could aid him.With this one,
all the forrces of nature that are occult and deep and strong
musst have worked together in some wonderous  way.  The  very
place,  wheree  he have been alive, Undead for all these cen-
turiees, is full of strangeness of the geologic  and chemical
world.  There aare deep caverns and fissures  that reach none
know whhither.  There have been volcanoes,some of whose open-
ings still send out waters of strange  properties, and gases
that killl or make to vivify.  Doubtless,  there is something
mmagnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult
forces whicch work for physical life  in  strange way, and in
himmself were from the first some great qualities.  In a hard
and warlike ttime he was  celebrate  that  he  have more iron
nervee, more subtle brain,more braver heart, than any man. In
him some vital  principle have in strange way found their ut-
most.   And as his  body  keep strong and grow and thrive, so
his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which
is surelyy to  him.  For it have to  yield to the powers that
ccome from, and  are, symbolic of good.  And now this is what
he is to uss.He have infect you, oh forgive me, my dear, that
I mmust say such, but it is for good of you that I speak.  He
infect you inn such wise, that even if he do no more,you have
only  to live, to live in your own old, sweet way, and so  in
time, death,whiich is of man's common lot and with God's sanc-
tion,  shall make you like to him.  This must not be! We have
sworn together tthat it must not.  Thus are we  ministers  of
God's owwn wish. That the world, and men for whom His Son die,
will not be given over to  monsters,  whose  very  existence
would deffame Him.  He have allowed us to redeem one soul al-
rready, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross  to re-
deem more.   Like them we shall  travel  towards the sunrise.
Andd like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause."
      He paused and I said,  "But will not the Count take his
rebuff wisely?   Since he has been driven from England,  will
he not  avoid it, as a tiger does the village from  which  he
has been hunted?"
     "Aha!" he ssaid, "your simile of the tiger good, for me,
and I shhall adopt him.  Your maneater, as they of India call

the tiger who has once tasted  blood  of the human, care  no
more for tthe other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him.
TThis that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a manea-
ter, and hee never cease to prowl.  Nay, in himself he is not
onee to retire and stay afar.In his life, his living life, he
go over the TTurkey frontier and attack his  enemy on his own
grounnd.  He be beaten back, but did he  stay?   No!  He come
again, and agaiin, and again. Look at his persistence and en-
durancee.  With the child-brain that  was to him he have long
since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does
he do?  HHe find out the place  of all the world most of pro-
mmise for him.   Then  he  deliberately  set  himself down to
prepare forr the task.  He find  in  patience just how is his
strrength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues.  He
learn new soccial life, new environment of old ways, the pol-
iticss, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new
land and a new  people who have come to be since he was.  His
glimpsee that  he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen
his desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain. For it
all provee  to  him how right he was at the first in his sur-
mmises.  He have done this alone, all alone! From a ruin tomb
in a forgottten land.What more may he not do when the greater
worrld of thought is open to him.  He that can smile at death,
as we know hhim.  Who can flourish in the midst  of  diseases
thatt kill off whole peoples.  Oh! If such an one was to come
from God, and  not the Devil, what a force for  good might he
not bee in this old world of ours.  But we are pledged to set
the world free.  Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts
all in ssecret. For in this enlightened age, when men believe

not even what they see,the doubting of wise men would be his
greatest sstrength.  It  would  be at once his sheath and his
arrmor, and his  weapons to  destroy us, his enemies, who are
willing to pperil even our own souls for the safety of one we
lovee.For the good of mankind, and for the honor and glory of
God."
     AfAfter  a  general discussion it was determined that for
tonight nothing  be  definitely settled.  That we should all
sleep on  the facts, and  try to think out the proper conclu-
ssions.  Tomorrow, at  breakfast,  we are  to meet again, and
after makinng our conclusions known to one another,  we shall
deccide on some definite cause of action . . .
     I feeel a wonderful peace and rest tonight.  It is as if
soome haunting presence were removed from me.  Perhaps . . .
     My surmiise was not finished, could not be, for I caught
sightt in the mirror of the red mark upon  my forehead, and I
knew that I wass still unclean.


 DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

     5 Octobober.--We all  arose early, and I think that sleep
did  much for each and all of us. When we met at early break-
fast there wass more  general cheerfulness than any of us had
ever eexpected to experience again.
     IIt is really wonderful  how much resilience there is in
human nature.  LLet any obstructing cause, no matter what, be
removed  in any way, even by  death, and we fly back to first

principles of hope and  enjoyment.  More than once as we sat
around thee table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole
off the past  days had not  been a dream.  It was only when I
caught sightt of the red blotch on Mrs.Harker's forehead that
I waas brought back to reality.  Even now, when I am  gravely
revolving the  matter,it is almost impossible to realize that
the caause of all our trouble is still  existent.  Even  Mrs.
Harker seems to  lose sight of her trouble for  whole spells.
It is onnly now and again, when something recalls  it to  her

mind, that she thinks of her terrible  scar.  We are to meet
here in myy study in half an hour and decide on our course of
acction.  I see only one immediate  difficulty, I  know it by
instinct ratther than reason.  We  shall  all  have  to speak
frannkly. And yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs.
Harker's tonggue is tied.  I know  that she forms conclusions
of heer own, and from all that has been I can guess how brill-
iant and how ttrue they must be. But she will not, or cannot,
give tthem utterance.   I have mentioned this to Van Helsing,
and he and I aree to talk it over when we are alone.I suppose
it is  ssome  of  that  horrid  poison which has got into her

veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when
he gave heer what  Van Helsing  called "the Vampire's baptism
off blood."  Well, there may be a poison that distills itself
out of good  things.In an age when the existence of ptomaines
is aa  mystery we should not wonder at anything!  One thing I
know,that if mmy instinct be true regarding poor Mrs.Harker's
silencces, then there is a  terrible  difficulty, an  unknown
danger, in the wwork before us.  The same power  that compels
her sileence may compel her speech. I dare not think further,

for so I should in my thoughts dishonor a noble woman!

     Later.--W-When the  Professor came in, we talked over the
state  of things.  I could  see  that he had something on his
mind, which he wwanted to say, but  felt some hesitancy about
broachinng the subject. After beating about the bush a little,
he said,"Friend John, there is something that you and I must
talk of aalone, just at the first at any rate.  Later, we may
hhave to take the others into our confidence."
     Theen he stopped, so I waited.  He went on, "Madam Mina,

our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing."
     A  cold   shiver  ran  through me to find my worst fears
thus  endorsed.  Van Helsing continued.
      "With  the  sad  experience  of Miss Lucy, we must this
time be warrned before things go too far.  Our task is now in
reaality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes
every  hour oof the direst importance.  I can see the charac-
terisstics of the vampire coming in her face.  It is  now but
very, very sligght.  But it is to be seen  if we have eyes to
notice  without prejudge.  Her teeth are sharper,and at times
her eyes are more hard.  But these are not all,  there is to
her the ssilence now often, as so it was with Miss Lucy.  She
ddid not speak, even when she wrote that which  she wished to
be known laater.  Now my fear is this. If it be that she can,
by  our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is
it not more ttrue that he  who have  hypnotize her first, and
who hhave drink of her very blood and  make her drink of his,
should if he wiill, compel her mind to  disclose  to him that
which sshe know?"
     I  nodded acquiescence. He went on,  "Then, what we must
do is to prevent this.  We must keep her ignorant of our in-
tent, andd so she cannot tell  what  she know not.  This is a
ppainful task!  Oh, so painful that it heartbreak me to think
of it, but  it must be.  When today we meet,  I must tell her
thaat for reason which we will not to speak she must not more
be of our couuncil, but be simply guarded by us."
     He wiped his forehead, which had broken  out in profuse
perspirattion at the thought of the pain which he might  have
tto inflict upon the poor soul already so  tortured.  I  knew
that it wouuld be some sort of comfort to him  if  I told him
thaat I also had come to  the  same  conclusion.  For at  any
rate it wouldd take  away the pain of doubt.  I told him, and
the eeffect was as I expected.
     It  iis now close  to the time of our general gathering.
Vaan Helsing has  gone away to  prepare for the meeting, and
his painful ppart of it.  I really believe his purpose is to
be ablle to pray alone.


     Later.--At  the very outset of our meeting a great per-
sonal rellief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself.
MMrs. Harker  had  sent a message by her husband to say that
she would noot join us  at present, as she thought it better
that  we should be free to discuss our movements without her
presence  to  emmbarrass  us.  The Professor and I looked at
each  othher  for  an  instant, and  somehow  we both seemed
reelieved.  For my own part, I thought  that if  Mrs. Harker
realized the   danger herself,  it  was much pain as well as
much ddanger averted.  Under the circumstances we agreed, by
a  questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to pre-
serve sileence in our suspicions, until we should have  been
ablle to confer alone again.  We went at once into  our Plan
of Campaign.

     Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first,"The
Czarina Cattherine left the Thames yesterday morning.It will
takee her at the quickest speed she has ever made  at  least
three weeks to  reach Varna.  But we can travel overland  to
the samee place in three days. Now, if we allow for two days
lless for the ship's voyage,owing to such weather influences
as we know tthat the Count can bring to bear,and if we allow
a whoole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
then we have a mmargin of nearly two weeks.
     "Thhus,in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on
117th at latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day
before the sship arrives, and able to make such preparations
as maay be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed, armed
against evil thiings, spiritual as well as physical."
     Here Quinceey Morris added,"I understand that the Count
comes froom a wolf country, and it may be that he shall  get
thhere before us.  I propose that we add Winchesters  to our
armament.  I   have  a  kind of  belief in a Winchester when
there  is any trouble of that sort around.  Do you remember,
Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk?What wouldn't
we have giiven then for a repeater apiece!"
      "Good!"  said  Van Helsing,  "Winchesters it shall be.
Quincey's heaad is level at times, but most so when there is
to hunnt,metaphor be more dishonor to science than wolves be
of danger  to man.  In the meantime we can do nothing here.
And as I tthink that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why
nott go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.
Tonight  and  tomorrow we can  get ready, and then if all be
well,  we four can set out on our journey."
     "We four?"   said Harker  interrogatively, looking from
one to annother of us.
      "Of course!" answered the Professor quickly. "You must
remain to take  care of your so sweet wife!"
     HHarker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow
voice,  "Let us talk of that  part of it in the morning.  I
want to coonsult with Mina."
     I  thought that  now was  the  time for Van Helsing to
warn him   not  to  disclose our plan to her, but he took no
nottice.I looked at him significantly and coughed.For answer
he put his finnger to his lips and turned away.


       JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


     October,  afternoon.--For some  time  after our meeting
this morniing I could  not think.  The  new  phases of things
leeave my mind in a  state of wonder which allows no room for
active thougght.  Mina's  determination  not to take any part
in tthe discussion set me thinking.  And as I could not argue
the matter witth  her,  I  could only  guess.  I am as far as
ever ffrom a solution now.  The way  the  others received it,
too puzzled me.   The last time we talked of  the  subject we
agreed tthat there was to be  no more concealment of anything

amongst us.  Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a
little chiild.  Her lips are curved and  her face  beams with
haappiness.  Thank God, there are such moments still for her.

     Laterer.--How strange  it  all is.  I sat watching Mina's
haappy sleep, and I came as near  to  being happy myself as I
suppose I shhall ever be.  As  the  evening drew  on, and the
eartth took  its  shadows from the sun sinking lower, the si-
lence of the rroom grew more and more solemn to me.
     All at  oncce  Mina  opened  her eyes, and looking at me
tenderlyy said, "Jonathan, I want you to promise me something

on your word of honor. A promise made to me, but made holily
in God's hhearing, and not to be broken though  I  should  go
doown on my knees and implore you with  bitter tears.  Quick,
you must makke it to me at once."
     "Mina," II said,  "a promise like that, I cannot make at
once.   I may have no right to make it."
      "But, dear one,"  she  said, with such spiritual inten-
sity that hher  eyes were  like pole stars, "it is I who wish
it..  And it is not for myself.  You can ask  Dr. Van Helsing
if I am not rright.  If he disagrees you  may do as you will.
Nay,  more if you all agree, later  you are absolved from the
promise."
       "I promise!"I said, and for a moment she looked suprem-
ely happy.  Thhough to me all happiness for her was denied by
the reed scar on her forehead.
     She saaid,   "Promise me that you  will not tell me any-
thiing of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count.
Not by word,, or inference, or implication,  not  at  any time
whiilst this remains to me!"  And she solemnly pointed  to the
scar.  I saww that she was in earnest,  and said solemnly,  "I
proomise!" and as I said it I felt  that from  that  instant a
door had beeen shut between us.

     Later, mimidnight.--Mina has been bright and cheerful all
the evvening.  So  much  so  that all the rest seemed to take
courage, as if iinfected somewhat with  her gaiety.  As a re-
sult eveen I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs

us down were somewhat lifted.  We  all  retired early.  Mina
is now sleeeping like a  little child.  It is wonderful thing
thhat her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her
terrible troouble.  Thank  God for it,  for then at least she
can  forget her care.  Perhaps  her  example may affect me as
her gaiety didd tonight.  I shall  try it.  Oh!  For a dream-
less ssleep.
     6 Octoober,  morning.--Another  surprise.  Mina  woke me
earrly, about the same  time as  yesterday,  and asked  me to
bring Dr. Vann Helsing.  I thought that it was another occas-
sion  for hypnotism, and  without  question went for the Pro-
fessor.  He  haad  evidently  expected  some such call, for I
found hhim dressed in his room.  His door  was  ajar, so that
he could hear the opening of the door of our  room.  He came
at once.   As he passed  into the  room, he asked Mina if the
oothers might come, too.
     "No," sshe said quite simply, "it will not be necessary.
You  can tell them just  as well.  I must go with you on your
journey."
       Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was.  After a mom-
ent's pause hhe asked,  "But why?"
     "You mustt  take  me with you.  I am safer with you, and
you shhall be safer, too."
     "But  why,,  dear Madam Mina?  You know that your safety
is our  solemnest duty.  We go into danger, to which you are,
or  may  be, more liable than any of us from . . . from cir-
cumstancees . . .  things that have  been."  He paused embar-
rrassed.
     As  sshe replied,  she  raised her finger and pointed to
heer forehead.  "I know.  That  is why I must go.  I can tell
you now,  whhilst  the  sun  is coming up.  I may not be able
agaiin.  I know that  when  the Count wills me  I must go.  I
know that if hhe tells me to come in secret, I must  by wile.
By anyy device to hoodwink, even Jonathan."  God saw the look
that she turned  on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a
Recordinng Angel that look is noted to her ever-lasting honor.
I could only clasp her hand.  I could not speak.  My emotion
was too ggreat for even the relief of tears.

     She went on.  "You men are brave  and  strong.  You are
strong in  your numbers, for  you can defy  that  which would
brreak down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone.
Besides, I  may be of service, since you can hypnotize me and
so  learn that which even I myself do not know."
     Dr.. Van Helsing said gravely,  "Madam Mina, you are, as

always, most wise.  You shall with us come.  And together we
shall do tthat which we go forth to achieve."

     When he had spoken,  Mina's  long spell of silence made
me look att her.  She  had fallen back  on her pillow asleep.
Shhe did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let
in the sunliight which flooded the room. Van Helsing motioned
to mme to  come with  him  quietly.  We went to his room, and
within a minutte  Lord Godalming,  Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris
were wwith us also.
      He told them what  Mina had said, and went on.  "In the
morning we shaall leave for  Varna.  We have now to deal with
a new  factor, Madam Mina.  Oh,  but her soul is true.  It is
to her an agony  to tell us so much as  she has done.  But it
is most  right, and we are warned in time.  There  must be no

chance  lost, and in  Varna  we must be ready to act the in-
stant whenn that ship arrives."
     "What shaall we do exactly?"asked Mr. Morris laconically.
      The Professor paused before replying,  "We shall at the
first board thaat ship.  Then,  when  we  have identified the
box, wee shall  place a branch of the wild rose on  it.  This
we shall fasten,  for when  it  is there none can emerge, so
that  at  least  says the  superstition.  And to superstition
mmust we trust at the first.  It was man's faith in the early,
and it havve its root in faith still.  Then, when we  get the
oppportunity that we seek, when none are near to see,we shall
open the boxx, and  . . .  and all will be well."
     "I shall noot  wait for any opportunity,"  said  Morris.
"When I  see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster,

though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am  to
be wiped oout for it the next moment!" I grasped his hand in-
sttinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.I think
he understoood my look.  I hope he did.
     "Goood boy," said Dr. Van Helsing.  "Brave boy.  Quincey

is all man.  God bless him for it. My child, believe me none
of us shalll lag behind or pause from any fear.  I do but say
whhat we may do . . . what we must do.  But, indeed,indeed we
cannot say wwhat we may do.There are so many things which may
happpen, and their ways and their ends are  so  various  that
until the momeent we may not say.  We shall all be  armed, in
all waays. And when the time for the end has come, our effort
shall not be lacck.  Now let us today  put all our affairs in
order.   Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and

who on us depend, be complete. For none of us can tell what,
or when, oor how, the end may be.  As  for me, my own affairs
arre regulate, and as I have  nothing else to do, I  shall go
make arrangeements for the  travel.  I shall have all tickets
and  so forth for our journey."
     Theere was nothing further to be said, and we parted.  I

shall now settle up all my affairs of earth,and be ready for
whatever mmay come.

     L Later.--It is done.  My will is made, and all complete.
Mina if  she surrvive  is my sole  heir.  If it should not be
so, thenn the others who have been so  good to us  shall have

remainder.
     IIt  is  now drawing towards the sunset.  Mina's uneasi-
ness  calls my   attention  to  it.  I  am sure that there is
somethinng on her mind  which the time  of exact  sunset will

reveal.  These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us
all.  For  each sunrise and sunset opens up some new  danger,
soome new pain, which however, may in  God's will be means to
a good end.   I write all these things in the  diary since my
darlling must not hear them now.  But if it may be  that  she
can see them aagain, they shall be ready.She is calling to me.

CHAPTER 25

                      DR SEWARD'S DIARY


     11 October,  Evening.--Jonathan  Harker has asked me to
note this,, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he
waants an exact record kept.
     I  tthink  that  none of  us were surprised when we were
aasked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset.
We have of  late come to  understand that  sunrise and sunset
aree to her times of peculiar freedom.  When her old self can
be  manifest   without  any controlling force subduing or re-
straiining  her,  or  inciting  her to  action.  This mood or
condition beginns  some  half hour or more before actual sun-
rise orr sunset, and  lasts  till  either the sun is high, or
whilst  the  clouds are  still aglow with the rays streaming
above  thhe  horizon.  At first there  is a  sort of negative
ccondition, as  if some tie were loosened, and then the abso-
lute freedoom  quickly follows.  When,  however, the  freedom
ceaases the change back or  relapse  comes quickly, preceeded
only by a speell of warning silence.
     Tonightt, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and
boree all the signs of an internal struggle.  I put  it  down
myself  to  heer  making  a  violent  effort at  the earliest
instannt she could do so.
     A very few  minutes,  however, gave her complete control
of herseelf.  Then,  motioning  her husband to sit beside her

on the sofa where she was  half reclining, she made the rest
of us brinng chairs up close.
     Taking her  husband's  hand in hers, she began,  "We are
all heree together in  freedom, for perhaps the last time!  I

know that you will always be with me to the end."   This was
to her hussband  whose  hand had,  as we could see, tightened
uppon her.  "In the  morning we go out upon our task, and God
alone  knowss  what may be in store  for  any of us.  You are
goinng to be so good to me to take me with you.  I know  that
all that bravee earnest men can  do  for  a  poor weak woman,
whose  soul perhaps is lost, no, no, not yet, but is  at  any
rate at stake, yyou will do.  But you must remember that I am
not as yyou are.  There is a poison in my blood, in my  soul,

which may destroy me, which must destroy me, unless some re-
lief comess to us.  Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do,
thhat my soul is at stake. And though I know there is one way
out for me,  you must not and I must not take it!" She looked
appeealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her
husband.
       "What is that way?" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.
"What is thatt way, which we must not, may not, take?"
     "That II may die now, either by my own hand  or  that of
anotther, before the greater evil is entirely wrought.I know,
and you know,  that were I once dead you could and  would set
free mmy immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy's.Were
death, or the feear of death,the only thing that stood in the
way I woould not shrink to die here now,  amidst the  friends

who love me.  But death is not all. I cannot believe that to
die in succh a case,when there is hope before us and a bitter
taask to be done, is God's will.Therefore, I on my part, give
up here the  certainty of  eternal  rest, and go out into the
darkk where may be the blackest things  that the world or the
nether world hholds!"
     We weere all silent, for we knew instinctively that this
waas only a prelude.  The faces  of  the others were set, and
Harker's greew ashen grey.  Perhaps, he  guessed  better than
any  of us what was coming.
     She conntinued, "This is what I can give into the hotch-
pot.."  I could not but note the  quaint legal  phrase  which
she used in suuch a place,  and with  all seriousness.  "What
will   each  of  you  give?  Your lives I know,"  she went on
quickly, "that iis easy for brave men.  Your lives are God's,
and you  can give them back to Him, but what will you give to

me?"  She looked again questionly, but this time avoided her
husband's  face.  Quincey seemed to understand,he nodded, and
heer face lit up. "Then I shall tell you plainly what I want,
for there muust be no doubtful matter  in this connection be-
tweeen us now.  You must promise me,one and all, even you, my
beloved husbannd,that should the time come, you will kill me."
      "What  is  that time?"  The voice was Quincey's, but it
was low and strrained.
     "Whenn you shall  be convinced that I am so changed that
itt is better  that  I  die  that I may live.  When I am thus
dead in the  flesh, then you will,  without a moment's delay,
drivve a stake  through me  and  cut off my head, or do what-
ever else may  be wanting to give me rest!"
     QQuincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt
down  before herr and  taking  her hand in his said solemnly,
"I'm onlly a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps,  lived  as  a

man should to win such a distinction, but I  swear to you by
all that II hold sacred and dear that, should the  time  ever
coome, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us.
And I promisse you, too, that  I  shall make all certain, for
if II am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!"
     "My truue friend!"  was all she could say amid her fast-
fallling tears, as bending over, she kissed his hand.
      "I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!"said Van Helsing.
"And I!" saidd Lord Godalming, each of them in turn  kneeling
to heer to take the oath.  I followed, myself.
     Then heer  husband  turned  to  her  wan-eyed and with a
greeenish pallor which  subdued the  snowy whiteness  of  his
hair, and askeed,  "And must I, too, make such a promise, oh,
my wiffe?"
     "You tooo, my  dearest,"she said, with infinite yearning
of piity in her voice  and  eyes.  "You must not shrink.  You
are nearest andd dearest and  all the world to me.  Our souls
are kniit into one, for all life and  all time.  Think, dear,
that there have been times when brave men have  killed their
wives andd their womenkind, to keep  them from  falling  into
tthe hands of the enemy.  Their hands  did not falter any the
more becausse  those  that  they loved implored them  to slay
theem.  It is men's duty towards  those whom  they  love,  in
such times off sore trial!  And oh,  my dear, if  it is to be
that  I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of
him that loves  me best.  Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgot-
ten youur mercy in poor Lucy's case to  him who loved."   She
stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase, "to him
who had bbest  right to give  her  peace.  If that time shall
ccome again, I look  to you to make  it  a happy memory of my
husband's llife that it was his loving hand which set me free
froom the awful thrall upon me."
     ""Again I swear!" came the Professor's resonant voice.

     Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled,as with a sigh of
relief shee leaned back and said,  "And now one word of warn-
inng, a warning which you must never forget.  This time,if it
ever come,   may  come quickly  and unexpectedly, and in such
casee you must lose no time in using your opportunity.At such
a time I mysellf might be . . . nay!  If the time  ever come,
shall  be, leagued with your enemy against you.
     "One moore request,"  she became very solemn as she said
thiss, "it is  not  vital and necessary like the other, but I
want you to doo one thing for me, if you will."
      We all acquiesced, but no one spoke.  There was no need
to speak.
 
     "I want you to read the Burial Service." She was inter-
rupted by aa deep groan from her husband.  Taking his hand in
herrs, she held it over her heart, and continued.  "You  must
read it over  me some day.  Whatever may be  the issue of all
this  fearful state of things, it will be  a sweet thought to
all or some of  us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for
then itt  will  be  in  your voice in my memory forever, come
what may!"
      "But  oh,  my dear one," he pleaded, "death is afar off
from you."
       "Nay,"  she  said,  holding  up  a warning hand.  "I am
deeper  in deeath at  this  moment than  if  the weight of an
earthhly grave lay heavy upon me!"
     ""Oh, my wife, must I read it?"he said, before he began.
     "It would ccomfort me, my husband!"  was  all  she said,
and he bbegan to read when she had got the book ready.
     Hoow can I,how could anyone, tell of that strange scene,
its solemnity,its gloom,its sadness, its horror, and withal,
its sweettness.  Even  a  sceptic, who  can see nothing but a
ttravesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional,would
have been mmelted to the heart had he seen that  little group
of  loving and devoted  friends kneeling  round that stricken
and sorrowingg lady.  Or heard the tender passion of her hus-
band''s voice, as in tones so broken and emotional that often
he  had  to  paause, he read the simple and beautiful service
from thhe Burial  of  the  Dead.   I  cannot  go  on  .  .  .
words  .  .  .  and v-voices  .  .  .  f-fail m-me!

     She  was  right  in  her  instinct.  Strange as it was,
bizarre ass  it may  hereafter seem  even to  us who felt its
pootent influence at the time, it comforted us much.  And the
silence, whiich showed Mrs. Harker's  coming relapse from her
freeedom  of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any  of
us as we had ddreaded.

         JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

     1515 October,  Varna.--We left Charing Cross on the morn-
ing of the  12th, got to Paris  the same night, and took the
places seecured for  us in the  Orient  Express.  We traveled
nnight  and  day,  arriving here at about five o'clock.  Lord
Godalming wwent to  the  Consulate to see if any telegram had
arrrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel,
"the Odessuss."  The journey may have had  incidents. I  was,
howeever, too eager to get on, to  care for them.  Until  the
Czarina Catherrine comes into port there will be no  interest
for mee in anything in the wide  world.  Thank God!  Mina  is
well, and looks  to be getting stronger.  Her color is coming
back.  SShe sleeps a great deal.  Throughout the  journey she

slept nearly all the time.  Before sunrise and sunset,  how-
ever, she  is very wakeful and alert.  And it  has  become  a
haabit for Van Helsing to hypnotize her  at  such  times.  At
first, some  effort was needed,and he had to make many passes.
Butt now, she seems to yield at once, as  if  by  habit,  and
scarcely any  action is  needed.  He  seems to have  power at
thesee particular moments to simply will,  and  her  thoughts
obey him.  He aalways asks her what she can see and hear.
     She annswers to the first,  "Nothing, all is dark."
     Andd to the second,"I can hear the waves lapping against

the ship, and the water rushing by.Canvas and cordage strain
and masts  and yards creak.  The wind is high  .  .  .  I can
heear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam."
     It is  evvident  that the  Czarina Catherine is still at
sea, hhastening on her way to Varna.  Lord Godalming has just
returned. He hadd four telegrams, one each day since we start-
ed,and  all to the same effect.That the Czarina Catherine had
not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere.  He had arranged
before leeaving  London  that his agent should send him every
dday a telegram saying if the ship had been reported.  He was
to have a mmessage even if she were not  reported, so that he
migght be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other
end of the wiire.
     We  had   dinner and went to bed early.  Tomorrow we are
to seee the Vice Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about get-
ting on board  the ship as soon as she arrives.  Van  Helsing
says tthat our chance will be to get on the boat between sun-
rise and sunset..  The Count, even if he takes  the form of a
bat, cannnot cross the running water of his own volition, and

so cannot leave the ship.  As he dare not  change  to  man's
form withoout  suspicion, which he evidently wishes to avoid,
hee must remain in the box.  If, then, we  can  come on board
after sunrisse, he is at our mercy, for  we  can open the box
and   make  sure  of him, as we did of poor Lucy,  before  he
wakes.  What mmercy he shall get from us  all  will not count
for muuch.  We think that we shall not have much trouble with
officials or thee seamen.  Thank  God!  This is  the  country
where brribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with

money.  We have only to make sure  that the ship cannot come
into port   between  sunset  and  sunrise  without  our being
waarned, and we shall be safe.Judge Moneybag will settle this
case, I thinnk!

     16 Octotober.--Mina's  report  still  the  same.  Lapping
wavees and rushing water, darkness and favoring winds. We are
evidently in ggood time, and when we hear of the Czarina Cat-
herinee we shall be ready.  As she must  pass the Dardanelles
we are sure to hhave some report.


     17 October..--Everything  is  pretty  well fixed  now, I
think, tto welcome the Count on his return from his tour. Go-

dalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box  sent
aboard migght contain something stolen from a friend  of his,
annd got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk.
The owner ggave him a paper telling the Captain  to  give him
eveery facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship,
and also a siimilar authorization to his agent at  Varna.  We
have  seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming's
kindly manner tto him, and we are all satisfied that whatever
he can  do to aid our wishes will be done.

     We have already  arranged what to do in case we get the
box open.   If  the  Count  is  there, Van Helsing and Seward
wiill cut off his head at once and  drive a stake through his
heart.  Morrris  and  Godalming and I shall prevent interfer-
encee, even  if  we  have to use the arms which we shall have
ready.  The  PProfessor  says  that  if  we  can so treat the
Count''s body, it will soon  after  fall into dust.  In  such
case  there  wouuld  be  no evidence  against us, in case any
suspicioon of murder were aroused.  But  even if it were not,

we should stand or fall by  our act, and  perhaps  some  day
this very  script may be  evidence to come between some of us
annd a rope.  For myself, I  should  take the chance only too
thankfully iif it were to come.  We mean  to  leave no  stone
untuurned to carry out  our  intent.  We  have arranged  with
certain officiials  that the instant the Czarina Catherine is
seen,  we are to be informed by a special messenger.

       24 October.--A  whole week of waiting.  Daily telegrams
to Godalming, bbut  only the same story.  "Not yet reported."
Mina's  morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried. Lap-
ping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.

           TELEGRAM, OCTOBER 24TH

"
"Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles."

DR. SEWARDRD'S DIARY

     2 25 October.--How  I  miss  my  phonograph!  To  write a
diary with a penn is irksome to me!  But  Van Helsing says  I
must. Wee were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godal-

ming got his telegram from Lloyd's. I know now what men feel
in battle  when the call to action is heard.Mrs.Harker, alone
off our party, did not show any signs of emotion.After all,it
is not strannge that she did not,for we took special care not
to llet her know anything about it, and we  all  tried not to
show any excittement when we were in her presence.In old days
she woould, I am sure, have noticed, no  matter  how we might
have tried to coonceal it.  But in  this way  she  is greatly
changed  during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon

her, and though she seems  strong  and  well, and is getting
back some  of her color, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied.
Wee talk of her often.  We have  not, however, said a word to
the others.   It would break  poor  Harker's heart, certainly
his  nerve, if he knew  that we  had  even a suspicion on the
subject.  Van  Helsing examines, he tells  me, her teeth very
carefuully, whilst she is  in the  hypnotic condition, for he
says that so lonng as  they  do not begin to sharpen there is
no activve danger of a change in her.  If this  change should

come, it would be necessary to take steps! We both know what
those stepps  would  have to be, though we do not mention our
thhoughts to each other.  We should neither of us shrink from
the task, awwful though it be to contemplate. "Euthanasia" is
an eexcellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever
invented it.

     It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to
here, at tthe rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London.
SShe should therefore arrive some time in the morning, but as
she cannot  possibly get  in before noon, we are all about to
rettire  early.  We shall get  up at one o'clock, so as to be
ready.

        25 October,  Noon.--No  news yet of the ship's arrival.
Mrs. Harker'ss hypnotic report  this  morning was the same as
usuall, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment.
We men are all  in a fever of excitement, except Harker,  who
is calmm.  His hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found
him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka  knife  which  he
now alwayys carries with him.It will be a bad lookout for the
CCount if the edge of that "Kukri" ever  touches  his throat,
driven by tthat stern, ice-cold hand!
     Van  Helsing  and  I  were  a  little alarmed about Mrs.
HHarker today.  About noon she got into  a  sort  of lethargy
which we diid not  like.  Although we  kept  silence  to  the
othhers,  we were neither of us happy about it.  She had been
restless all   the morning, so  that we were at first glad to
know  that she  was  sleeping.  When,  however,  her  husband
mentioned casuaally that  she was sleeping so soundly that he
could nnot wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.
She was breathinng naturally and looked so well and  peaceful
that  wee  agreed that the sleep was better for her than any-

thing else.  Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is
no wonder  that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her
goood.

     Later.r.--Our  opinion  was  justified, for  when after a
reffreshing sleep of  some  hours she  woke  up,  she  seemed
brighter  andd  better than she had been for days.  At sunset
she mmade the usual  hypnotic  report.  Wherever he may be in
the Black Sea,  the Count is hurrying to his destination.  To
his dooom, I trust!


 
     26 October.--Another day  and no tidings of the Czarina
Catherine.   She ought to be  here by now.  That she is still
jouurneying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic
report at sunnrise was  still the  same.  It is possible that
the vvessel may be lying  by, at times, for fog.  Some of the
steamers which  came  in last evening reported patches of fog
both too north and  south  of the port.  We must continue our
watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.

     27 Octobober, Noon.--Most  strange.  No  news  yet of the
ship  we wait for.  Mrs. Harker reported last night  and this
morning as usuaal.  "Lapping waves and rushing water," though
she addded that "the waves were very  faint."  The  telegrams
from London have been  the same,  "no further  report."  Van
Helsing iis  terribly  anxious, and told  me just now that he
ffears the Count is escaping us.
      He added significantly,  "I  did not like that lethargy
of  Madam  Minna's.  Souls and memories can do strange things
duringg  trance."  I was  about  to as k him more, but Harker
just then came iin, and he held up a warning  hand.  We  must
try toniight at sunset to make  her speak  more fully when in

her hypnotic state.

    28 Octobeber.--Telegram. Rufus  Smith, London, to Lord
    Godallming, care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna
    "Czarina   Catherine  reported entering Galatz at one
    o'clocck today."

 DR. . SEWARD'S DIARY


     28 October.--When  the  telegram  came  announcing  the
arrival inn Galatz I do not think it was such a shock  to any
off us as might  have been expected.  True,  we did  not know
whence, or hhow, or when, the bolt would come. But I think we
all  expected that something strange would happen. The day of
arrival at Varrna made us individually  satisfied that things
would  not be just as we had expected.We only waited to learn
where the changee would occur. None the less, however, it was
a surpriise.  I suppose that nature works on  such  a hopeful

basis that we believe against ourselves that things  will be
as they ouught to be, not as we should know that they will be.
TTranscendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a
will-o'-thee-wisp to man.  Van Helsing  raised  his hand over
hiss head for a moment, as though  in  remonstrance  with the
Almighty.  Buut he said not a word,and in a few seconds stood
up wiith his face sternly set.
     Lord   Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heav-
illy.  I was  myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one
after anotheer.  Quincey  Morris tightened his belt with that
quicck  movement which I knew  so well.  In our old wandering
days it  meantt "action."  Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
that tthe scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded
her hands  meeklly  and looked up  in prayer.  Harker smiled,
actuallyy smiled,the dark, bitter smile of one who is without

hope, but at the  same time his action belied his words, for
his hands  instinctively  sought the  hilt of the great Kukri
knnife and rested there.
     "When dooes  the  next train start for Galatz?" said Van
Helsiing to us generally.
     "At 6:30   tomorrow morning!"   We  all started, for the
answer  came from Mrs. Harker.
     "How onn earth do you know?" said Art.
      "You forget,  or  perhaps you do not know, though Jona-
than does  andd  so does Dr. Van Helsing, that I am the train
fiend..  At home in  Exeter I always used to make up the time
tables, so  as   to be helpful  to my husband.  I found it so
useful ssometimes, that  I  always  make  a study of the time

tables now.  I  knew  that  if  anything were  to take us to
Castle Draacula  we should  go  by Galatz,  or  at  any  rate
thhrough  Bucharest,  so  I learned the times very carefully.
Unhappily thhere are  not  many  to  learn, as the only train
tomoorrow leaves as I say."
     "Wonderrful woman!" murmured the Professor.
     "Can't we get a special?" asked Lord Godalming.
     Van Helsing shook his head,  "I fear not.  This land is
very diffferent from yours or mine.  Even if  we did  have  a
sspecial, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular
train.  Morreover, we have something to prepare.We must think.
Noow let us organize.  You, friend Arthur,go to the train and
get the tickkets and arrange that all  be  ready for us to go
in tthe morning.  Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of
the ship and gget from him  letters  to  the agent in Galatz,
with aauthority to make  a search  of the ship just as it was
here.  Quincey MMorris, you  see the Vice Consul, and get his
aid withh his fellow in  Galatz and all he can do to make our

way smooth, so that  no times  be lost when over the Danube.
John will  stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult.
Foor so if time be  long you may be delayed.  And it will not
matter when   the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make
repoort."
     "And I,,"  said  Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her
old  self than she  had  been for many a long day, "shall try
to be of use iin all ways, and shall think and write  for you
as  I   used to  do.  Something  is  shifting from me in some
strange way, andd I feel freer than I have been of late!"
     The  thhree  younger men looked happier at the moment as
theyy seemed  to realize  the significance of her words.  But
Van Helsing annd  I, turning  to each other, met each a grave
and trroubled glance.  We said nothing at the time, however.
     When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Hel-
sing askeed Mrs.Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and
ffind him the part of Harker's journal at the Castle.She went
away to gett it.
     When  tthe  door  was  shut upon her he said to me,  "We
meann the same!  Speak out!"
     "Here  is some change.  It is a hope that makes me sick,
forr it may deceive us."
     "Quite soo.  Do  you  know  why  I  asked her to get the
manusccript?"
     "No!""  said  I, "unless it was to get an opportunity of
seeeing me alone."
      "You are in  part right, friend John, but only in part.
I want  to   tell you  something.  And  oh,  my  friend, I am
takking a great, a terrible, risk. But I believe it is right.
In the momentt when Madam Mina said those  words that  arrest
both  our understanding, an inspiration came to  me.  In  the
trance of threee days ago the  Count  sent her his  spirit to
read heer mind.  Or more like he took her to see  him  in his
earth box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free
at rise aand set of sun.  He learn then that we are here, for
sshe have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see ears
to hear thaan he, shut as he is, in  his  coffin box.  Now he
makke his most effort to escape us.At present he want her not.
     "He  iss  sure with his so great knowledge that she will
comee at his  call.  But he  cut her off, take her, as he can
do, out of hiss own power, that so  she come not to him.  Ah!
There  I have hope that our man brains  that have been of man
so long and thatt have not lost the grace  of  God, will come
higher tthan his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centur-

ies, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work
selfish annd therefore small.  Here comes Madam  Mina.  Not a
woord to her of her trance!  She knows  it not, and  it would
overwhelm heer and  make  despair just when  we want all  her
hopee, all her courage, when most we want all her great brain
which is trainned like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and
have aa special power which the Count give her,  and which he
may not take awaay altogether, though he think not so.  Hush!
Let me sspeak, and you shall learn.  Oh,  John, my friend, we

are in awful straits.  I fear, as I never feared before.  We
can only ttrust the good God. Silence!  Here she comes!"
      II thought  that  the Professor was going to break down
and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died,but with a
great  efffort he  controlled  himself  and  was  at  perfect
nnervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright
and  happy  looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly for-
gettful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of
sheets of typpewriting to Van Helsing.  He  looked  over them
graveely, his face brightening up as he read.
     Then hollding the pages between his finger and thumb  he
said,,  "Friend John, to you with so much experience already,
and you too, deear Madam Mina, that  are  young,  here  is  a
lesson..  Do not fear ever to think.  A half thought has been
buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him  loose  his
wings.  HHere now, with more  knowledge, I go back  to  where
tthat half thought come from and I  find that  he be no  half
thought at  all.That be a whole thought, though so young that
he  is not yet strong to use his little wings.  Nay, like the
`Ugly Duck' oof my friend Hans Andersen,he be no duck thought
at alll, but a big swan thought that sail nobly on big wings,
when the time ccome for him to try them. See I read here what
Jonathaan have written.
      "That  other of his race who, in a later age, again and
again, brouught  his  forces over The Great River into Turkey
Lannd, who when he was  beaten  back, came  again, and again,
and again, thhough he had to come alone from the bloody field
wheree his troops were being slaughtered, since  he knew that
he alone could  ultimately triumph.
     "What doess this tell us?   Not  much?  No!  The Count's
child tthought see nothing, therefore he speak so free.  Your
man thought see nothing.  My  man  thought see nothing, till
just now..  No!  But there comes  another  word from some one
wwho speak without thought because she, too, know not what it
mean, what  it might mean.  Just as there  are elements which
resst, yet when in nature's course they move on their way and
they touch,   the  pouf!  And  there  comes a flash of light,
heaveen wide, that blind and kill and destroy some.  But that
show up all earrth below for leagues and  leagues.  Is it not
so?  Weell, I shall  explain.  To begin, hav e you ever study
the philosophy  of  crime?  `Yes' and `No.'  You, John, yes,
for it  iis  a  study of  insanity.  You, no, Madam Mina, for
ccrime touch you not, not but  once.  Still, your mind  works
true, and aargues not a particulari ad universale.  There  is
thiis peculiarity in criminals.  It is  so  constant, in  all
countries andd at all times, that even police,  who  know not
much  from philosophy, come to know  it empirically, that  it
is.  That is too be empiric.  The criminal always work at one
crime,  that is the true criminal who  seems  predestinate to
crime, and who will of none other.This criminal has not full
man brainn.  He is clever and cunning and resourceful, but he
bbe not of man stature as to brain.  He be of  child brain in
much.  Now  this criminal of ours is pre-destinate  to  crime
alsso.  He, too, have child brain, and it  is of the child to
do what he haave done.  The little bird, the little fish, the
littlle animal learn not by principle,  but empirically.  And
when he learn tto do,then there is to him the ground to start
from too do more.  `Dos pou sto,' said  Archimedes.  `Give me
a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!'  To  do once, is the
fulcrum wwhereby child brain become  man brain.  And until he
hhave the purpose to do more,he continue to do the same again
every time,, just as he have done before!  Oh, my dear, I see
thaat your  eyes  are  opened, and  that to you the lightning
flash show alll the leagues,"for Mrs.Harker began to clap her
handss and her eyes sparkled.
     He wennt on,  "Now you shall speak.  Tell us two dry men
of  science what you see with those so bright eyes."  He took
her hand and  held it whilst he spoke.  His  finger and thumb
closeed  on her pulse, as I thought instinctively  and uncon-
sciously, as shhe spoke.
     "Thhe  Count is a criminal and of criminal type.  Nordau

and Lombroso would so classify him, and qua  criminal he  is
of an impeerfectly formed mind.  Thus, in a difficulty he has
too seek  resource in habit.  His past is a clue, and the one
page of it   that we  know, and that from his own lips, tells
thatt once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a`tight
place,' he wennt back to his own country from the land he had
tried  to invade, and thence,without losing purpose, prepared
himself for a neew effort.  He came again better equipped for
his workk, and won. So he came to London to invade a new land.
He was beaten,and when all hope of success was lost, and his
existencee in danger, he fled back over  the sea to his home.
JJust as formerly  he  had fled  back  over the  Danube  from
Turkey Landd."
     "Good, goood!  Oh, you so clever lady!" said Van Helsing,
enthuusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.A moment
later he said tto me, as calmly as though we had  been having
a sick  room consultation,  "Seventy-two only,and in all this
excitement.  I have hope."
     Tuurning  to  her again, he  said with keen expectation,
"But go on.  Go on!  There is more  to tell if you will.  Be
not afraiid.  John and I know.  I  do in any case, and  shall
ttell you if you are right.  Speak, without fear!"
      "I will try to.  But you will forgive me if I seem  too
egotistical.""
     "Nay!  Fear  not, you must be egotist, for it is of you
that we tthink."
     "Thenn, as  he is  criminal  he is selfish.   And as his
inntellect is small and his action is based on selfishness,he
confines himmself to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless.
As  he fled back over the Danube,leaving his forces to be cut
to pieces,so  now he is intent on being safe, careless of all.
So hhis own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terr-
ible power whiich he acquired over me on that dreadful night.
I feltt it!  Oh, I felt it!  Thank God,  for His great mercy!
My soul is freerr than it has been since that awful hour. And
all thatt haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he

may have used my knowledge for his ends."
     The Prrofessor stood up,  "He has so used your mind, and
by  it  he  has left us  here  in Varna, whilst the ship that
carried  him   rushed through  enveloping  fog up  to Galatz,
wheree, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping  from
us.  But his chhild mind only saw so far.  And it may be that
as everr is in God's Providence, the very thing that the evil
doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns  out to be
his chieffest harm.  The hunter is taken in his own snare, as
tthe great Psalmist says.  For now that  he think he is  free
from every  trace of us all, and  that he has escaped us with
so  many  hours  to  him, then  his  selfish child brain will
whisper him tto sleep.  He think, too, that as he cut himself
off ffrom knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him
to you.  There  is where he fail!  That  terrible  baptism of
blood wwhich  he  give  you makes  you  free  to go to him in
spirit, as you have as yet done in  your times  of  freedom,
when the  sun rise and set.  At such times you go by my voli-
ttion  and  not  by  his.  And this power to  good of you and
others, youu have won from your suffering at his hands.  This
is  now all more precious that he know  it not, and  to guard
himself have  even cut himself off from his knowledge of  our
wheree. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God
is with us throough all this blackness, and these  many  dark
hours.   We shall follow him, and we shall not flinch.Even if
we peril ourselves that  we become like  him.  Friend  John,
this has  been a great hour, and it have done much to advance
uus on our way. You must be scribe and write him all down, so
that when tthe others return from their work you can give  it
to  them, then they shall know as we do."
     And so I   have written it  whilst we wait their return,
and Mrss. Harker has  written  with  the typewriter all since
she brought the MS to us.


CHAPHAPTER 26

                     DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

       29 October.--This is written in the train from Varna to
Galatz.  Lastt  night  we  all  assembled a little before the
time  of sunset.  Each of us  had done his work as well as he
could, so far aas thought, and  endeavor, and opportunity go,
we are  prepared for the whole of  our  journey,  and for our
work when we get to Galatz.  When the usual  time came round
Mrs. Harkker  prepared  herself for her  hypnotic effort, and
aafter a longer  and  more  serious effort on the part of Van
Helsing thaan  has  been usually necessary, she sank into the
traance.  Usually  she  speaks  on  a hint, but this time the
Professor hadd to ask her questions, and  to  ask them pretty
resollutely, before  we  could  learn anything.  At  last her
answer came.
 
     "I can see  nothing.  We are still.  There are no waves
lapping,  bbut  only  a  steady swirl of water softly running
agaainst the hawser.  I  can  hear men's voices calling, near
and far, and  the roll and creak  of oars in the rowlocks.  A
gun iis fired somewhere, the echo of it seems far away. There
is tramping of  feet overhead, and ropes and chains are drag-
ged aloong.  What is this?  There is a gleam of light.  I can
feel the air blowing upon me."
      Here  she  stopped.  She  had risen, as if impulsively,
from where shhe lay  on  the sofa, and raised both her hands,
palmss upwards, as if lifting  a  weight.  Van  Helsing and I
looked at each  other with understanding.  Quincey raised his
eyebrowws slightly and looked at her intently,whilst Harker's
hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There
was a lonng pause.  We all knew that the time  when she could
sspeak was passing, but we felt that it was  useless  to  say
anything.

     Suddenly  she  sat  up, and as she opened her eyes said
sweetly,   "Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all
bee so tired!"
      We could  only  make her happy, and so acqueisced.  She
bustled off to  get tea.  When she had gone Van Helsing said,
"You seee, my friends.  He is close to land.  He has left his
earth chest.  But he has yet to get on shore.  In  the night
he may liie hidden  somewhere,  but  if he be not carried  on
sshore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the
land. In suuch case he can, if it be in the  night,change his
forrm and jump or fly on shore, then, unless he be carried he
cannot escapee.  And if he  be carried,  then the customs men
may   discover what the  box contain.  Thus, in  fine,  if he
escape not on sshore tonight, or  before  dawn, there will be
the whoole day lost to him.  We may then arrive in time.  For
if he  escape not at night we shall  come on him in daytime,
boxed up  and at our mercy. For he dare not be his true self,
aawake and visible, lest he be discovered."
     There   was no more to be said, so we waited in patience
unttil the dawn, at which  time we might learn more from Mrs.
Harker.
       Early this morning we listened,with breathless anxiety,
for her responnse in her trance.  The hypnotic stage was even
longerr in coming than before, and when it  came the time re-
maining until fuull sunrise  was so short that  we  began  to
despair.. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the

effort.  At last, in obedience to his will she made reply.
     "All iss dark.  I hear lapping water, level with me, and
somee creaking as of wood on wood."  She paused, and  the red
sun shot up.   We must wait till tonight.
     Andd so it is  that  we are travelling towards Galatz in

an  agony  of expectation.  We are due to arrive between two
and three  in  the  morning.  But  already, at  Bucharest, we
arre three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well
after sunup..  Thus we shall have two more hypnotic  messages
fromm Mrs. Harker!  Either or both  may possibly  throw  more
light on what  is happening.

 
     Later.--Sunset has come and gone.  Fortunately it  came
at a time wwhen there was no distraction. For had it occurred
whiilst we were at a station, we might not have  secured  the
necessary callm  and isolation.  Mrs. Harker  yielded  to the
hypnootic influence even  less readily than this  morning.  I
am in fear thatt her power of reading the  Count's sensations
may diee away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that
her imagination is beginning to work.  Whilst  she  has been
in the trrance hitherto she has confined herself to the simp-
llest of facts.  If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us.
If I thougght that the  Count's power over her would die away
eqqually with her  power  of  knowledge  it  would be a happy
thought.  Buut I am afraid that it may not be so.
     When she diid  speak,  her words were enigmatical,"Some-
thing iss going out.  I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.

I can hear, far off, confused sounds, as of  men  talking in
strange toongues, fierce falling  water, and the  howling  of
woolves."   She  stopped  and a shudder ran  through her, in-
creasing in  intensity for a few seconds,  till  at  the end,
she  shook as though in a palsy.  She said no  more, even  in
answer to the  Professor's imperative  questioning.  When she
woke ffrom the trance, she was cold, and  exhausted, and lan-
guid, but her miind was all alert.   She could  not  remember
anythingg, but asked what  she  had said.  When she was told,

she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence.

     30 O October, 7 a.m.--We are near Galatz now, and  I  may
nnot have time to write later.  Sunrise this morning was anx-
iously lookked for by us all. Knowing of the increasing diff-
icuulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,  Van  Helsing began
his passes eaarlier than usual. They produced no effect, how-
ever,, until the regular time, when she  yielded with a still
greater difficuulty, only a minute before the  sun rose.  The
Professsor lost no time in his questioning.
     Her answer came with equal quickness,  "All is  dark. I
hear wateer swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking
oof wood on wood.  Cattle low far off. There is another sound,
a queer onne like  .  .  ."  She stopped and grew  white, and
whhiter still.
      "Go on, go on!  Speak, I command you!" said Van Helsing
in an agonized  voice.  At the same time there was despair in
his eyees, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker's
pale face.  She opened her eyes, and we all  started as  she
said, sweeetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern.
     "OOh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't?
I don't remember anything."  Then, seeing the look of amaze-
ment on oour faces, she said, turning  from one to  the other
wwith a troubled look,  "What have I said?  What have I done?
I know nothhing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and
heaard you say `go on! speak, I command  you!'  It  seemed so
funny to hearr you order me about, as if I were a bad child!"
      "Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof,if proof
be needed, of hhow I love and honor you, when a word for your
good, sspoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange be-
cause it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!"
      The whistles are sounding. We are nearing Galatz.We are
on fire witth anxiety and eagerness.

MINA HARARKER'S JOURNAL

 
     30 October.--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where  our
rooms had   been  ordered  by telegraph, he being the one who
couuld best be spared, since he does  not speak  any  foreign
language.  Thhe forces were distributed much as they had  been
at VVarna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice Consul,
as his  rank   might  serve as  an immediate guarantee of some
sortt to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and
the two doctoors  went to the  shipping agent to learn partic-
ularrs of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.

     Latater.--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away,
and the  Vice  Consul  sick.  So  the  routine work has been
attended  to by a clerk. He was very obliging, and offered to
ddo anything in his power.

          JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

     3030 October.--At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr.Seward,
and I called on  Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of
the Londdon firm of Hapgood.  They had received a  wire  from

London, in answer to  Lord Godalming's telegraphed  request,
asking theem to show us any civility in their power.They were
moore than kind and courteous, and took us at once  on  board
the Czarina  Catherine, which lay at anchor out  in the river
harbbor. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told
us of his voyaage.  He said that in all his life he had never
had soo favorable a run.
     "Man!"  he said,  "but it made us afeard, for we expect
it that wwe should have to pay for it wi' some rare piece  o'
iill luck, so as to keep up the average. It's no canny to run
frae Londonn to the Black Sea wi' a wind ahint ye, as  though
thee  Deil  himself were blawin' on yer sail for his ain pur-
pose.  An' a'' the time we could no speer a thing.Gin we were
nigh  a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog  fell on us and
travelled wi' uus,till when after it had lifted and we looked
out, thhe deil a thing could we see.  We ran by Gibraltar wi'
oot bein' able to signal. An' til we came to the Dardanelles
and had tto wait to get our  permit  to  pass, we never  were
wwithin hail o' aught.  At first I inclined to slack off sail
and beat abbout till the fog was lifted. But whiles, I thocht
thaat if the Deil was  minded to  get us  into  the Black Sea
quick, he wass like to do it whether we would or no.If we had
a quiick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi'the owners,
or no hurt to  our traffic,an' the Old Mon who had served his
ain  ppurpose  wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin'
him."
     Thihis mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition

and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing,who said,"Mine
friend, thhat Devil is more clever than he is thought by some,
aand he know when he meet his match!"
     The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and
went on,   "When we got past the Bosphorus the  men  began to
ggrumble.  Some o' them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to
heave overbboard a big box which  had  been put on board by a
queeer lookin' old man just before we had started frae London.
I had seen tthem speer at the  fellow, and put  out their twa
finggers when they saw him,to guard them against the evil eye.
Man!  but  thhe supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly ri-
deecuulous!  I sent them aboot their business  pretty  quick,
but as just aftter a fog closed in on us I  felt a wee bit as
they diid anent something, though I wouldn't say it was again
the big box.  Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up
for five  days I joost let the wind carry us, for if the Deil
wwanted to get somewheres, well, he would fetch it up a'reet.
An' if he ddidn't, well,  we'd  keep  a sharp lookout anyhow.
Surre eneuch, we had a  fair way and deep water all the time.
And two days  ago, when the mornin' sun came through the fog,
we foound ourselves  just in the river  opposite Galatz.  The
Roumanians weree wild,  and wanted me right  or wrong to take
out thee box  and  fling it in  the river.  I had to argy wi'
them aboot it wi' a  handspike.  An'  when the  last o' them
rose off  the  deck wi' his head in his hand, I had convinced
tthem that,  evil  eye or  no  evil eye, the property and the
trust of myy owners were better in my hands than in the river
Dannube.They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
fling in, andd as it was marked Galatz via Varna,I thocht I'd
let   it  lie  till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't
althegither.  WWe  didn't  do much clearin' that day, an' had
to remaain the nicht at anchor.  But in the mornin', braw an'
airly, an hour before sunup, a man came aboard wi' an order,
written tto him from England, to receive a box marked for one
CCount Dracula.  Sure eneuch the matter  was one ready to his
hand.  He hhad his papers a' reet, an' gla d I  was to be rid
o'  the dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy
at it.  If thhe Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship,I'm
thinkkin' it was nane ither than that same!"
     "What  waas the  name of the man who took it?" asked Dr.
Van Heelsing with restrained eagerness.
      "I'll  be  tellin' ye quick!" he answered, and stepping
down to  hiss  cabin,  produced  a  receipt  signed "Immanuel
Hilddesheim."  Burgen-strasse 16 was the  address.  We  found
out that this  was all the Captain  knew, so  with thanks  we
came aaway.
     We  fouund  Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather
the  Adelphi Theatre  type, with  a  nose like a sheep, and a
fez.  His arguuments were pointed with  specie, we  doing the
punctuuation, and with a little  bargaining  he told us  what
he knew.  This tturned out  to  be  simple but important.  He
had receeived a letter  from  Mr. de Ville of London, telling

him to receive, if possible before  sunrise  so  as to avoid
customs, aa box  which would arrive at Galatz in the  Czarina
Caatherine.  This  he  was  to  give  in  charge to a certain
Petrof Skinssky, who dealt with the Slovaks  who  traded down
the  river to the port.  He had been paid for his work  by an
English bank nnote, which had been duly cashed  for  gold  at
the Daanube International Bank.  When Skinsky had come to him,
he had taken hiim to the ship and handed  over the box, so as
to savee parterage.  That was all he knew.

     We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him.
One of hiis neighbors,who did not seem to bear him any affec-
ttion, said that he had gone away two days before,no one knew
whither.  TThis was corroborated by his landlord, who had re-
ceiived by messenger the key of the house together  with  the
rent due, in  English money.  This had  been  between ten and
eleveen o'clock last night.  We were at a standstill again.
     Whilst we were talking one came running and breathless-
ly gaspedd out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside
tthe wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat
had been toorn open as if by some wild animal.  Those we  had
beeen speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women cry-
ing out.  "Thhis is the work of a Slovak!"   We  hurried away
lest  we should have been in some way drawn into the  affair,
and so detainedd.
     As we camee home  we could arrive at no definite conclu-
sion.   We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by
water,to somewhere, but where that might be we would have to
discover..With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina.

     When we met together, the first thing was to consult as
to taking  Mina again into our confidence. Things are getting
deesperate, and it is at least a chance, though  a  hazardous
one.  As a ppreliminary step, I was released  from my promise
to hher.

         MIMINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

     30 Octobober,  evening.--They  were so tired and worn out
and ddispirited that  there was nothing  to be done till they
had some rest,  so I asked them all to lie  down  for half an
hour whhilst I should enter  everything  up to the moment.  I
feel so  grateful  to the man who invented the "Traveller's"
typewriteer,  and  to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me.
II should have  felt  quite astray doing the work if I had to
write with  a pen  .  .  .
      It is all done.  Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must
have suffereed, what he must be suffering now. He lies on the
sofaa hardly seeming to breathe,and his whole body appears in
collapse.  Hiss brows are knit.  His face is drawn with pain.
Poor ffellow, maybe he is thinking,and I can see his face all
wrinkled up withh the concentration of his thoughts. Oh! if I
could onnly help at all. I shall do what I can.
     I have assked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the
paperss that I have not yet seen.  Whilst they are resting, I
shall go over alll carefully,and perhaps I may arrive at some
conclusiion.  I  shall try to follow the Professor's example,

and think without prejudice on the facts before me  .  .  .
     I do bbelieve that under God's providence I have made a
disccovery.  I shall get the maps and look over them.
      I am more than ever sure that I am right.  My new con-
clusion is readdy,so I shall get our party together and read
it.  Theey can judge it.  It  is well to  be  accurate,  and
eevery minute is precious.

          MINA HARKER'S MEMORANDUM
        (EENTERED IN HER JOURNAL)

     Grounund of inquiry.--Count  Dracula's  problem is to get
baack to his own place.
     (a)  He   must  be  brought  back  by some one.  This is
evidennt.  For had he power  to  move himself as he wished he
could go either   as  man, or  wolf, or bat, or in some other
way.  Hee evidently  fears discovery  or interference, in the

state of helplessness in which he must be, confined as he is
between daawn and sunset in his wooden box.
      (b)  How  is  he to be taken?--Here a process of exclu-
sions may heelp us.  By road, by rail, by water?
     1.  By Road.--There  are  endless difficulties, especi-
ally in lleaving the city.

     (x)  There  are  people.  And  people  are curious, and
investigatte.  A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be
inn the box, would destroy him.
     ((y)  There  are,  or  there  may be, customs and octroi
officers to passs.
     (z)  His   pursuers  might follow.  This  is his highest
fear.   And in order to prevent  his  being betrayed  he  has
repelled, so far as he can, even his victim, me!
      2.  By Rail.--There is no one in charge of the box.  It
would have  tto  take  its chance of being delayed, and delay
wouldd be fatal, with enemies  on  the track.  True, he might
escape at nightt.  But what would he be, if left in a strange
place wwith no refuge that he could fly to?  This is not what
he intends, and he does not mean to risk it.
     3..  By Water.--Here  is the safest way, in one respect,
but with most danger in another.  On  the water he is power-
less exceept at night.  Even  then he can only summon fog and
sstorm and  snow  and his wolves.  But  were  he wrecked, the
living wateer would engulf him, helpless, and he would indeed
be  lost.  He could have the vessel  drive to land, but if it
were unfrienddly land, wherein he was  not  free to move, his
posittion would still be desperate.
      We know from  the  record  that he was on the water, so
what we have too do is to ascertain what water.
      The first thing is to  realize exactly what he has done
as yet.  We mmay, then, get a light on what his task is to be.
      Firstly.--We must differentiate between what he did  in
London as partt of his general plan of action,  when  he  was
presseed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.
      Secondly we must see, as well as we can surmise it from
the facts wee know of, what he has done here.
      As  to  the  first, he  evidently intended to arrive at
Galatz, and  sent invoice to  Varna  to  deceive  us  lest we
shouuld ascertain his means of exit from England.  His immed-
iate and sole  purpose then was to escape. The proof of this,
is thee letter of instructions sent ot Immanuel Hildesheim to
clear and take aaway the box before sunrise.There is also the
instructtion to Petrof Skinsky.  These we must only guess at,

but there must have been some letter or message, since Skin-
sky came tto Hildesheim.
      That,  so far,  his plans were successful we know.  The
Czarina Catheerine made a phenomenally quick journey. So much
so thhat Captain Donelson's suspicions were aroused.  But his
superstition unnited with his  canniness played  the  Count's
game foor him, and he ran with his favoring wind through fogs
and all till he brought up blindfold at  Galatz.  That  the
Count's arrrangements were well made, has been proved.Hilde-
sheeim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky.
Skinsky took iit, and here we lose the  trail.  We only know
that  tthe box is somewhere on the water, moving along.  The

customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.
     Now wee come to what the Count must have done after his
arriival, on land, at Galatz.
     The bbox  was given to Skinsky before sunrise.  At sun-
risse the Count could appear in his own form.  Here, we  ask
why  Skinsky   was chosen at all to aid in the work?  In  my
husbandd's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as  dealing  with the

Slovaks who trade down the river to the port. And the man's
remark,thatt the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the
geneeral  feeling against  his class.  The Count wanted iso-
lation.
     M My  surmise is  this, that in London the Count decided
to get back to  his castle  by  water, as the most safe and
secret wayy.  He was brought from  the castle by Szgany, and
proobably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the
boxes to Varnaa, for there they were shipped to London. Thus
the Couunt had knowledge of  the persons  who could  arrange

this service.  When the box was on land, before  sunrise or
after sunseet, he came  out  from his box, met  Skinsky  and
insttructed him what to do as  to  arranging the carriage of
the box up somee river. When this was done, and he knew that
all was  in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,
bby murdering his agent.
     I  havee examined  the map and find that the river most
suitaable for the  Slovaks  to  have  ascended is either the
Pruth or the Serreth.  I read in the typescript  that  in my
trance I  heard cows low  and  water  swirling level with my
eaars and the creaking of wood.  The Count in his box, then,
was on  a rivver  in an open boat, propelled probably either
by  oaars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working
against  stream.  There would  be  no such if floating down
stream.
 
     Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth,
but we  mayy possibly investigate further.  Now of these two,
thee Pruth  is  the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is,
at Fundu, joiined  by  the Bistritza which runs up round the
Borgo  Pass.  The loop  it  makes  is manifestly as close to
Dracula's castle as can be got by water.

     MINANA HARKER'S JOURNAL--CONTINUED

       When  I  had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms
and kissed  mee.  The  others  kept shaking me by both hands,
and Drr. Van Helsing said,  "Our dear Madam Mina is once more
our teacher.  Heer eyes have been where we were blinded.  Now
we are oon the track once again, and this time we may succeed.
Our enemy is at his most helpless. And if we can come on him
by day, oon the water, our task will be over. He has a start,
bbut he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave this  box
lest those  who carry him may suspect.  For  them  to suspect
wouuld be to prompt them to throw him in the stream  where he
perish. This  he knows, and will not. Now men, to our Council
of Waar, for here and now, we must plan  what  each  and  all
shall do."
       "I shall get a steam launch and follow him,"  said Lord
Godalming.
 
     "And  I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he
land," saidd Mr. Morris.
      "Good!"  said the  Professor,  "both good.  But neither
must go  alonee.  There  must  be  force to overcome force if
need bbe.  The  Slovak  is  strong  and rough, and he carries
rude arms."  Alll  the  men  smiled,  for  amongst them  they
carried  a small arsenal.

     Said  Mr. Morris,  "I  have  brought  some Winchesters.
They are ppretty handy in a crowd, and  there  may be wolves.
Thhe Count, if you remember, took some other precautions.  He
made some reequisitions on others that Mrs. Harker  could not
quitte hear or understand.  We must be ready at all points."
     Dr. Sewardd said,  "I think I had better go with Quincey.
We havve been accustomed to hunt together, and we  two,  well
armed, will be aa match for whatever may come along. You must
not be aalone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks,

and a chance thrust, for I don't suppose these fellows carry
guns, woulld undo all our plans.There must be no chances,this
tiime.  We shall not rest  until  the Count's head  and  body
have been  sseparated,  and  we are sure that he cannot rein-
carnnate."
     He  loooked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked
at  me.  I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his
mind.  Of couurse he wanted to be with me.  But then the boat
serviice would, most likely, be the one which  would  destroy
the .  .  .  thhe  .  .  .  Vampire.  (Why did I  hesitate to
write tthe word?)
     Hee was  silent  awhile,  and during his silence Dr. Van
Helsing spoke,  "Friend  Jonathan,  this is to you for twice
reasons.   First, because you  are  young and  brave  and can
ffight, and all energies may be needed at the last. And again
that it is  your right to destroy him.That, which has wrought
succh woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina. She
will be my caare, if I may.  I am old.  My  legs  are  not so
quickk to run as once.  And I am not used to ride so  long or
to pursue as neeed be, or to fight with lethal  weapons.  But
I can bbe of other service.  I can fight in other way.  And I
can die, if need be, as well as younger men.  Now let me say
that whatt I would is this.  While you, my Lord Godalming and
ffriend Jonathan go in your so swift  little steamboat up the
river, and  whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where per-
chaance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into
the heart of  the enemy's country. Whilst the old fox is tied
in hiis box, floating on the  running stream whence he cannot
escape to land,, where he dares not raise the lid of his cof-
fin boxx lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
perish, we shall go  in the track  where Jonathan went, from
Bistritz  over the  Borgo,  and find our way to the Castle of
DDracula.  Here,Madam Mina's hypnotic power will surely help,
and we shalll  find  our way, all dark and unknown otherwise,
aftter the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place.
There is muchh to be  done, and other places to be made sanc-
tify,, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated."
     Heere  Jonathan  interrupted him hotly,  "Do you mean to
say, Professor  Van Helsing,  that  you would bring Mina, in
her sad ccase and tainted as she is with that devil's illness,

right into the jaws of his deathtrap? Not for the world! Not
for Heavenn or Hell!"
     HHe became almost speechless for a minute, and then went
on, "Do you knoww what the place is? Have you seen that awful
den of hhellish infamy, with  the very  moonlight  alive with

grisly shapes,and ever speck of dust that whirls in the wind
a devourinng monster in embryo?  Have you felt  the Vampire's
liips upon your throat?"
     Here  hee  turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my fore-
head  he threw up his arms with a cry, "Oh, my God, what have
we done to havee this terror upon us?"  and he sank  down  on
the soffa in a collapse of misery.
     Thee Professor's voice,as he spoke in clear, sweet tones,
which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all.
      "Oh,  my  friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina
from  that  awful place  that  I would go.  God forbid that I
shoould take her into that place.  There  is work, wild work,
to be done beefore that place  can be  purify.  Remember that
we  aare  in  terrible straits.  If  the Count escape us this
time, and he iss strong and subtle and cunning, he may choose
to sleeep him for a century, and then  in time our dear one,"
he took my hand, "would come to him to keep him company, and
would be  as those others that you, Jonathan, saw.  You  have
ttold us of their gloating lips. You heard their ribald laugh
as they cluutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them.
Yoou shudder, and well may it be.  Forgive me that I make you
so much painn, but it is necessary.  My  friend, is it  not a
diree need for that which I am giving, possibly  my life?  If
it, were that  any one went into  that place to stay, it is I
who woould have to go to keep them company."
     "Do as youu will,"  said Jonathan, with a sob that shook
him alll over, "we are in the hands of God!"

     Later.--O-Oh, it did me good to  see  the  way that these
brave   men  worked.  How can women help loving men when they
are  so  earnestt, and  so  true, and so brave!  And, too, it
made me  think of the  wonderful power of money!  What can it

not do when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godal-
ming is riich, and both he and Mr. Morris,who also has plenty
off money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did
not,our litttle expedition could not start,either so promptly
or sso well equipped, as it will within another hour.  It  is
not three hourrs since it was arranged what  part  each of us
was too do. And now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely
steam launch, wiith steam up  ready  to  start at  a moment's
notice.   Dr. Seward and  Mr. Morris have half a  dozen  good

horses, well appointed.  We have all the maps and appliances
of variouss kinds that can be had.  Professor Van Helsing and
I  are to leave by the 11:40 train tonight for Veresti, where
we are to geet a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.  We are
brinnging a good deal of ready money,as we are to buy a carr-
iage and horsees.  We shall drive  ourselves,  for we have no
one whhom we can trust in  the  matter.  The  Professor knows
something of a ggreat many languages, so we shall  get on all
right. WWe have all got arms, even for me a large bore revol-

ver.  Jonathan would not be happy  unless  I  was armed like
the rest.   Alas!  I cannot carry one  arm  that the rest do,
thhe scar on my forehead forbids that.  Dear  Dr. Van Helsing
comforts me  by telling me that I am fully armed as there may
be wwolves.  The weather is getting  colder  every  hour, and
there are snoww flurries which come and go as warnings.

     Laterer.--It took all my courage to say goodby to my dar-
liing.  We  may  never  meet again.  Courage, Mina!  The Pro-
fessor is  llooking  at  you  keenly.  His look is a warning.
Therre  must  be no tears now, unless it may be that God will
let them fall  in gladness.

         JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

       30 October, night.--I am writing this in the light from
the furnace   door  of the steam launch.  Lord  Godalming  is
firiing up.  He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has
had for years  a launch of his own on the Thames, and another
on  thhe Norfolk Broads.  Regarding our plans, we finally de-
cided that Mina''s guess was correct,and that if any waterway
was chossen for the Count's escape back to  his  Castle,  the

Sereth and then the Bistritza at its  junction, would be the
one. We toook it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north
laatitude, would be the place chosen for crossing the country
between the  river and the  Carpathians.  We  have no fear in
runnning at good speed up the river at night. There is plenty
of water, and  the banks are wide enough apart to make steam-
ing, eeven in the dark, easy enough.  Lord Godalming tells me
to sleep for a wwhile,as it is enough for the present for one
to be onn watch. But I cannot sleep, how can I with the terr-

ible danger  hanging over my darling, and her going out into
that awfull place  .  .  .
      My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God.Only
for that faaith it would be easier to die than to live,and so
be  quit of all the trouble.  Mr. Morris and  Dr. Seward were
off on their  long ride before we started.They are to keep up
the rright bank, far enough off to get  on higher lands where
they can see a  good stretch of river and avoid the following
of its  curves.  They have, for the  first stages, two men to
ride and lead their spare horses, four  in all, so as not to
excite cuuriosity.  When they dismiss the men, which shall be
sshortly, they shall themselves look after the horses. It may
be necessarry for us to join forces. If so they can mount our
whoole party. One of the saddles has a moveable horn, and can
be easily adaapted for Mina, if required.
     Itt is  a  wild  adventure  we  are on.  Here, as we are
rushing  along through  the darkness, with the cold from the
river seeeming to rise up and strike us, with all the myster-
iious voices of the night around us,it all comes home.We seem
to be driftting into unknown places and unknown ways.  Into a
whoole world of dark and dreadful things.  Godalming is shut-
ting the furnnace door  .  .  .

     31 Octoberr.--Still hurrying along.The day has come, and
Godalmiing is sleeping.I am on watch. The morning is bitterly
cold, the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur
coats. Ass yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none
oof them had on board any box or package of anything like the
size of thee one we seek.  The men were  scared every time we
turrned our electric lamp on them,and fell on their knees and
prayed.

  
     1 November, evening.--No news all day.  We have   found
nothing  of   the kind  we seek.  We have now passed into the
Bisttritza, and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance  is
gone.  We havee overhauled every boat, big and little.  Early
this mmorning, one crew took us for a  Government  boat,  and
treated us accorrdingly.  We saw in this a  way  of smoothing
matters,,so at Fundu,where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth,
we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With
every boaat which we have over-hauled since  then  this trick
hhas succeeded.  We have had every deference shown to us, and
not once anny objection to  whatever  we  chose to ask or do.
Somme of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, go-
ing at more tthan usual  speed  as  she had  a double crew on
boardd. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not
tell us whetherr the boat turned into the Bistritza or contin-
ued onn up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear of any such
boat, so she musst have passed there in the night. I am feel-
ing veryy sleepy.  The cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon

me, and nature must have  rest some time.  Godalming insists
that he shhall keep the first  watch.  God bless  him for all
hiis goodness to poor dear Mina and me.

     2 Novembeber, morning.--It is  broad daylight.  That good
felloww would not wake me.  He says  it would have been a sin
to, for I slept  peacefully and was forgetting my trouble. It
seems brrutally selfish to me to have slept so long,  and let

him watch all night, but he was quite right.  I am a new man
this morniing.  And, as I sit here and watch him sleeping,  I
caan  do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine,
steering,  aand  keeping  watch.  I can feel that my strength
and  energy are  coming back to  me.  I  wonder where Mina is
now, and Van HHelsing.  They should have got to Veresti about
noon oon Wednesday.  It would take them some time  to get the
carriage and horrses.  So  if  they had started and travelled
hard, thhey  would be about now at the Borgo Pass.  God guide

and help them!  I am afraid to think what may happen.  If we
could onlyy go faster.  But we cannot.  The engines are throb-
bbing and doing their utmost.  I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr.
Morris aree getting on.  There seem to be endless streams run-
nning down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
are very laarge, at present, at all events,  though  they are
douubtless terrible in winter and when  the snow  melts,  the
horsemen may  not have met much obstruction.  I hope that be-
fore  we get to Strasba we may see them.  For if by that time
we have not oveertaken the Count, it may be necessary to take
counsell together what to do next.

 DR. S SEWARD'S DIARY

 
     2 November.--Three days on the road.  No news,  and  no
time  to  wwrite  it  if there  had been, for every moment is
preecious.  We have had only the rest needful for the horses.
But we are  bboth bearing it wonderfully.  Those  adventurous
days  of ours  are  turning  up useful.  We must push on.  We
shall never feeel happy till we get the launch in sight again.

       3 Novenber.--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone
up the Bistrittza. I wish it wasn't so cold.  There are signs
of snoow coming.  And if  it falls heavy it will stop us.  In
such case we musst get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion.
     4 Novvenber.--Today we  heard  of the launch having been
deetained by an  accident  when  trying to force a way up the
rapids.  Thee Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope
and  steering with knowledge.  Some went up only a few  hours
before.Godalmiing is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently
it wass he who put the launch in trim again.
     Finally,   they  got up the rapids all right, with local
help, aand are off on the chase afresh.  I fear that the boat
is not any better for the  accident, the peasantry  tell  us
that afteer she got upon smooth water again,she kept stopping
eevery now and again so long as she was in sight.We must push
on harder tthan ever.  Our help may be wanted soon.

         MIMINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

     31 Octobober.--Arrived at Veresti at noon.  The Professor
tellss me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotize
me  at  all, annd that all I could say was, "dark and quiet."
He is ooff now buying a carriage and horses.  He says that he
will  later on  try to buy additional horses, so that we may
be able tto change  them on  the way.  We have something more
tthan 70 miles before us.  The  country  is  lovely, and most
interestingg.  If only  we were under  different  conditions,
howw delightful it would be to see it all.  If Jonathan and I
were driving  through it alone what a pleasure it would be.To
stop  and see people, and learn something of their life,  and
to fill our minnds and memories with all the color and pictur-
esquenness of the whole wild,beautiful country and the quaint
people!  But, allas!

     Later.r.--Dr. Van  Helsing  has returned.  He has got the
carrriage  and  horses.  We  are to have  some dinner, and to
start  in  ann  hour.  The landlady  is  putting us up a huge
baskeet  of  provisions.  It  seems enough  for  a company of
soldiers.  The  Professor encourages her, and  whispers to me
that itt may be a week before we  can get any food again.  He
has  been  shopping  too, and has sent home such a wonderful
lot of  ffur  coats and  wraps, and all sorts of warm things.
TThere will not be any chance of our being cold.
     WWe  shall soon  be  off.  I am afraid to think what may
happen to us.  WWe  are  truly in the hands of God.  He alone
knows whhat may be, and I  pray Him, with all the strength of

my sad and humble soul, that  He  will watch over my beloved
husband.   That  whatever  may happen, Jonathan may know that
I  loved him and honored him more than I can say, and that my
latest and ttruest thought will be always for him.


CHAPTER 27 27

                     MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

     1 1 November.--All day long we have travelled, and  at  a
good speed.  Thee  horses seem  to  know that they are  being
kindly   treated, for they go willingly their full  stage  at

best speed.We have now had so many changes and find the same
thing so cconstantly that we are encouraged to think that the
joourney will be an easy one.  Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he
tells the faarmers that he is hurrying to  Bistritz, and pays
themm well to make the exchange of  horses.  We get hot soup,
or coffee, or  tea,  and off  we go.  It is a lovely country.
Full oof beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are
brave, and  stroong, and simple, and seem full of nice quali-
ties. Thhey are very, very superstitious.  In the first house

where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw  the scar
on my foreehead, she crossed herself and put out  two fingers
toowards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to
the trouble  of putting an extra amount of  garlic  into  our
foodd, and I can't abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken
care not to taake off my hat or  veil, and  so  have  escaped
their  suspicions.  We are travelling fast, and as we have no
driver with us tto carry  tales, we go ahead of scandal.  But
I daresaay that fear of the  evil eye will follow hard behind

us all the way.  The  Professor seems  tireless.  All day he
would not  take any  rest, though he made me sleep for a long
sppell.At sunset time he hypnotized me,and he says I answered
as usual,"daarkness, lapping water and creaking wood." So our
enemmy  is still on the river.  I am afraid to think of Jona-
than, but someehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself.
I writte this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to
be ready.  Dr. VVan Helsing is sleeping.  Poor dear, he looks
very tirred and old and grey, but his mouth is set as  firmly

as a conqueror's. Even in  his sleep he is intense with res-
olution.   When we  have well  started I must make  him  rest
whhilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,
and  he  muust  not break  down when most of all his strength
willl be needed  .  .  .  All is ready.  We are off shortly.

     2 Novemember,  morning.--I was  successful, and  we  took
turnns driving all night. Now the day is on us, bright though
cold.  There iis a strange heaviness in the air.  I say heav-
iness  for want of a better word. I mean that it oppresses us
both.  It is verry cold, and only our warm furs keep  us com-
fortablee.  At dawn Van Helsing hypnotized me. He says I ans-

wered "darkness, creaking  wood and  roaring  water," so the
river is cchanging as they ascend.  I do hope that my darling
wiill not run any chance of danger, more than need be, but we
are in God'ss hands.

     2 2 November,  night.--All day long driving.  The country
gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians,
which  aat  Veresti  seemed so far from  us and so low on the

horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front.  We
both seem  in good spirits. I think we make an effort each to
chheer the other, in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van
Helsing sayss that by morning we shall reach the  Borgo Pass.
The  houses are very few here now,and the Professor says that
the last horsee we got will have to go  on with us, as we may
not bee able to change.  He got two in addition to the two we
changed, so thatt now we have a rude  four-in-hand.  The dear
horses aare patient and good, and they give us no trouble. We

are  not  worried  with  other travellers, and so even I can
drive. We  shall get to the Pass in daylight.  We do not want
too arrive before.  So we take  it easy, and have each a long
rest in turnn.  Oh, what will tomorrow bring to us?  We go to
seekk the place where my poor darling  suffered so much.  God
grant that we  may be guided aright,and that He will deign to
watch  over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are
in such deadly pperil.As for me, I am not worthy in His sight.
Alas!   I  am  unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may
deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who
have not  incurred His wrath.

  MEMORANDUM M BY ABRAHAM VAN HELSING

     4 Novovember.--This to my old and true friend John Seward,
MM. D., of Purefleet, London, in case I may not see  him.  It
may explainn.  It is morning, and I write by a fire which all
thee night I have kept alive, Madam Mina aiding me.It is cold,
cold. So colld that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which
whenn it falls will settle for  all  winter  as the ground is
hardening to rreceive it.It seems to have affected Madam Mina.
She hhas been so heavy  of head all day that she was not like
herself.She sleeeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual
so alerrt, have done literally nothing all the day.  She even
have lost her  appetite.  She make no  entry into her little
diary, shhe who write so faithful at  every pause.  Something
wwhisper to me that all is not well.  However, tonight she is
more vif.Heer long sleep all day have refresh and restore her,
foor now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset I try
to hypnotizee her, but alas! with  no  effect.  The power has
growwn  less and  less  with each day, and tonight it fail me
altogether.  WWell,  God's  will  be done, whatever it may be,
and wwhithersoever it may lead!
     Now   to  the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in
hher stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so
each day off us may not go unrecorded.
     We  got  to  the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday

morning.  When I  saw  the signs of the dawn I got ready for
the  hypnootism.  We  stopped  our  carriage, and got down so
thhat there  might  be no  disturbance.  I  made a couch with
furs, and Maadam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual,but
moree slow  and  more short  time  than ever, to the hypnotic
sleep.  As beffore, came the answer, "darkness and the swirl-
ing off water."  Then she woke, bright and radiant and we  go
on our way and ssoon reach the Pass.  At this time and place,
she becoome all on fire with zeal.  Some new guiding power be

in her manifested, for she point to a road and say, "This is
the way.""
     "How know you it?" I ask.
      "Of  course  I  know it,' she answer, and with a pause,
add,  "Have nnot my  Jonathan travelled  it and wrote of  his
traveel?"
     At  firsst I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that
theree be  only one  such byroad.  It is used but little, and
very different  from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bis-
tritz,  which is more wide and hard, and more of use.
     Soo  we  came down this  road.  When we meet other ways,
not always  were we  sure that they  were roads at  all, for
they be nneglect and light  snow have fallen, the horses know
aand they only.I give rein to them, and they go on so patient.
By and by  we find all the things which Jonathan have note in
thhat wonderful diary of him.  Then we go on  for  long, long
hours and hoours.  At the first, I tell Madam Mina to  sleep.
She  try, and she succeed.She sleep all the time, till at the
last, I feel mmyself to suspicious  grow, and attempt to wake
her.   But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.
I do not wish too try too  hard lest I  harm her.  For I know
that shee have suffer much, and sleep at times  be all-in-all

to her.  I think I drowse  myself,  for all of sudden I feel
guilt, as  though I have  done something.  I find myself bolt
upp, with the reins in  my hand, and the good horses go along
jog, jog, juust as ever.I look down and find Madam Mina still
asleeep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow
the light  of  the  sun  flow in big yellow flood, so that we
throw  great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
For  we  are  gooing up, and  up, and all  is oh, so wild and
rocky, aas though it were the end of the world.
     Then I  aarouse Madam Mina.  This time she wake with not
much ttrouble, and  then  I try to put her to hypnotic sleep.
But she sleep noot, being as though  I were not.  Still I try
and try,, till all at once  I find her and myself in dark, so

I  look  round, and find that the sun have gone down.  Madam
Mina  lauggh, and  I turn and look at  her.  She is now quite
awwake, and look so well as I never saw  her since that night
at Carfax whhen we first enter the Count's house.  I am amaze,
andd not at ease then.  But she is so  bright  and tender and
thoughtful foor me that I forget all fear.  I light  a  fire,
for wwe have brought supply of wood with us, and  she prepare
food while I unndo the horses and set them, tethered in shel-
ter, too feed.  Then when I return to the  fire  she  have my
supper ready.  I go to help  her, but she smile, and tell me
that she  have eat already.  That she  was so hungry that she
wwould not wait.  I like it not,and I have grave doubts.  But
I fear to aaffright her, and so  I am silent of it.  She help
me  and I eat alone, and then we wrap  in fur and  lie beside
the fire, andd I tell her to sleep while I watch.But present-
ly I  forget all of watching. And when I sudden remember that
I watch, I findd her lying quiet,  but  awake, and looking at
me withh so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and
I get much sleep  till before morning.  When I wake I try to
hypnotizee her, but alas!  Though she shut her eyes obedient,
sshe may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up, and then
sleep come  to her too late, but so heavy  that  she will not
wakke.  I have to lift her up, and place her  sleeping in the
carriage whenn I have harnessed the horses and made all ready.
Madaam still sleep,and she look in her sleep more healthy and
more redder thhan before. And I like it not.  And I am afraid,
afraiid, afraid! I am afraid of all things, even to think but
I must go on myy way. The stake we play for is life and death,
or morre than these, and we must not flinch.

     5 Novembmber, morning.--Let me be accurate in everything,
for tthough you and I have seen some strange things together,
you may at the  first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad. That
the manny horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the
last turn my brain.
     All  yestterday  we travel, always getting closer to the
mountaains, and  moving into  a more and more wild and desert
land.  There aree great, frowning precipices and much falling
water, aand Nature seem to have held sometime  her  carnival.

Madam Mina still sleep and sleep. And though I did have hun-
ger and apppeased it, I could not waken her, even for food. I
beegan to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her,
tainted as  she is with that Vampire baptism.  "Well," said I
to  myself, "if it be that she  sleep  all  the day, it shall
also be that  I do not sleep at night."  As we  travel on the
roughh road,for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there
was, I held dowwn my head and slept.
     Again I wwaked with a sense of guilt and of time passed,
and foound Madam  Mina  still sleeping, and the sun low down.
But  all was inddeed  changed.  The frowning mountains seemed
further  away,  and we  were near  the  top of a steep rising

hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan  tell
of in his  diary.  At once I exulted and feared.  For now,for
goood or ill, the end was near.
     II woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotize her,but
alas! unavailingg till too late.Then, ere the great dark came
upon us,, for even after down sun  the heavens  reflected the

gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twi-
light.  I  took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I
coould.  Then I make a fire, and near it I  make  Madam Mina,
now awake annd more charming than ever, sit comfortable  amid
her  rugs.  I got ready  food, but she would not  eat, simply
saying that shhe had not hunger.  I did not press her,knowing
her unnavailingness.  But I myself eat, for I  must needs now
be strong for alll.  Then, with the  fear on me of what might
be, I drrew a ring so big for her comfort,  round where Madam

Mina sat.  And over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and
I broke itt fine so that all was well guarded.  She sat still
alll the time, so still as one dead.  And she grew whiter and
even whiter  till the snow was not more pale, and no word she
saidd.  But when I  drew  near, she clung  to me, and I could
know that the  poor soul shook her  from  head to feet with a
tremorr that was pain to feel.
     I saidd to her presently, when she had grown more quiet,
"Wiill you not come over to the fire?" for I wished to make a
test of what  she could.  She  rose  obedient, but  when  she
have  made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.
      "Why not go on?" I asked.She shook her head, and coming
back, sat ddown in her place.  Then, looking at  me with open
eyees, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply,"I cannot!"
and remainedd silent.  I rejoiced, for I  knew  that what she
coulld not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there
might be dangeer to her body, yet her soul was safe!
     Presently  the horses began to scream, and tore at their
tetherss till I came to them and quieted them.  When they did
feel my hands on them,they whinnied low as in joy,and licked
at my hannds and were quiet for a time.Many times through the
nnight did I come to them, till it  arrive  to  the cold hour
when all naature is at lowest, and every  time my  coming was
witth quiet of them.  In the cold hour the fire began to die,
and I was aboout stepping  forth to replenish it, for now the
snow  came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in
the dark there   was a  light of  some kind, as there ever is
over snnow, and it seemed as though the snow flurries and the
wreaths of  mist  took  shape as of women with trailing gar-
ments.  AAll was in dead,  grim silence  only that the horses
wwhinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst.  I began
to  fear, hhorrible  fears.  But then came to me the sense of
saffety in that  ring wherein I stood.  I began too, to think
that  my  imaaginings  were of  the night, and the gloom, and
the uunrest that  I  have  gone through, and all the terrible
anxiety.  It  wwas as  though  my  memories of all Jonathan's
horrid  experience  were befooling  me.  For  the snow flakes
and the mist began to wheel  and circle round, till  I could
get as  tthough  a shadowy  glimpse of those women that would
hhave kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower,
and moanedd in terror as men do in pain.  Even the madness of
frright  was not to them, so that  they could  break away.  I
feared for mmy dear Madam Mina when these  weird figures drew
nearr and circled round.  I looked at her, but  she sat calm,
and smiled at  me.  When I would have  stepped to the fire to
replennish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered,
like a voice thaat one hears in a dream, so low it was.
     "No!  No!!  Do not go without.  Here you are safe!"
     I turnned to her,  and looking in  her  eyes said,  "But
youu?  It is for you that I fear!"
      Whereat she  laughed, a laugh low and unreal, and said,
"Fear for me!   Why fear for me?  None safer in all the world
from tthem than I am,"and as I wondered at the meaning of her
words, a puff off wind made the flame leap up, and I  see the
red scarr on her forehead.  Then, alas! I knew.  Did I not, I

would soon have  learned, for  the wheeling figures  of mist
and snow ccame  closer, but keeping  ever  without  the  Holy
ciircle. Then they began to materialize till, if God have not
taken away mmy reason, for I saw it  through my  eyes.  There
weree before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jon-
athan saw in  the room,when they would have kissed his throat.
I knnew the swaying round forms, the  bright  hard eyes,  the
white teeth,   the  ruddy  color, the  voluptuous lips.  They
smiledd ever at poor dear Madam Mina. And as their laugh came
through the sileence of the night, they twined their arms and
pointed  to her, and said in  those  so sweet tingling  tones

that Jonathan said were of the intolerable  sweetness of the
water glassses,  "Come, sister.  Come to us. Come!"
     In  feaar I  turned  to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart
withh gladness leapt like flame.  For oh! the  terror in  her
sweet eyes, thhe repulsion,  the horror,  told a story  to my
heart  that was all of hope.  God be thanked she was not, yet
of them.  I seizzed some of the firewood which was by me, and
holding  out some of the Wafer, advanced on them  towards the

fire.  They drew back before me,and laughed their low horrid
laugh.  I  fed the fire, and feared them not. For I knew that
wee were safe within the ring,  which she could  not leave no
more than thhey could enter.  The  horses had ceased to moan,
and  lay still on the ground. The snow  fell on  them softly,
and they grew  whiter.  I  knew  that there  was for the poor
beastss no more of terror.
     And  so  wwe  remained till the red of the dawn began to
fall thhrough the snow gloom.  I was desolate and afraid, and
full of  woe and terror.  But when that  beautiful sun began
to  climbb  the  horizon life was  to me again.  At the first
ccoming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling
mist and snnow.  The wreaths of transparent gloom moved  away
towwards the castle, and were lost.
      Instinctively, with  the dawn coming, I turned to Madam
Mina, intendiing to hypnotize her.  But she lay in a deep and
suddeen sleep, from which I  could not  wake her.  I tried to
hypnotize throuugh her sleep, but she made no  response, none
at all,, and the day broke.  I fear yet to stir.  I have made
my fire and have seen  the horses, they are all dead.  Today
I have muuch to do here,and I keep waiting till the sun is up
hhigh.  For there may be places where I  must  go, where that
sunlight, tthough snow and mist obscure it,  will be  to me a
saffety.
     I will  strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will do
my tterrible work.Madam Mina still sleeps, and God be thanked!
She is calm iin her sleep  .  .  .

     4 Novemember,  evening.--The accident to the  launch  has
beenn a terrible thing for us.  Only  for it we  should  have
overtaken the   boat long ago, and  by now my dear Mina would
have bbeen free.  I  fear to think of her,  off  on the wolds
near that horridd place.  We have got horses, and  we  follow
on the ttrack.  I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready.
We have our arms.  The Szgany must look out if they  mean to
fight.  OOh, if only Morris and Seward were  with us. We must
oonly hope!  If I write  no more Goodby Mina!  God  bless and
keep you.


DR. SEWARD'S DIAARY

     5 Novemember.--With the  dawn  we saw  the body of Szgany
befoore  us  dashing  away from  the  river with their leiter
wagon.  They ssurrounded  it in a  cluster, and hurried along
as thoough beset.  The snow  is  falling lightly and there is
a strange exciteement in the air.  It may be our own feelings,
but thee depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of
wolves.  The snow brings them down from the  mountains,  and
there aree dangers to all of us,and from all sides.The horses
aare nearly ready, and we are soon off.  We ride  to death of
some one.   God alone knows who, or  where, or what, or when,
or  how it may be  .  .  .

      DR. . VAN HELSING'S MEMORANDUM

     5 N November, afternoon.--I am  at least sane.  Thank God

for that mercy at all events, though the proving it has been
dreadful.   When I left  Madam Mina sleeping  within the Holy
ciircle, I took my way to the castle.  The  blacksmith hammer
which I tookk in the carriage from Veresti was useful, though
the   doors  were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges,
lest some ill   intent  or ill  chance should  close them, so
that   being entered I might not get  out.  Jonathan's bitter
experience serveed me here.  By  memory  of his diary I found
my  way  to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay.

The air  was  oppressive.  It  seemed as  if  there was some
sulphurouss fume, which at times made me dizzy.  Either there
waas  a  roaring in  my  ears or I heard afar off the howl of
wolves. Thenn I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was
in tterrible plight.  The dilemma had me between his horns.
     Her,  I  haad not dare to take into this place, but left
safe froom the Vampire in  that  Holy  circle.  And  yet even

there would be the wolf!  I resolve me that my work lay here,
and that  as to the wolves we must submit, if  it were  God's
wwill.  At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond.  So
did I choosse for her.  Had it but been for myself the choice
hadd been easy, the maw of the wolf were  better  to  rest in
than the gravve of the Vampire!  So I make my choice to go on
with  my work.
     I kknew  that  there were at least three graves to find,

graves that  are  inhabit.  So  I  search, and search, and I
find one oof them.  She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full  of
liife and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though  I  have
come to do mmurder.  Ah,  I doubt not  that in the  old time,
whenn such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a
task as mine,  found at the last his heart fail him, and then
his neerve.  So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere
beauty  and the  fascination of the wanton Undead have hypno-
tize himm. And he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the

Vampire sleep be over.  Then  the beautiful eyes of the fair
woman openn and look love,and the voluptuous mouth present to
a  kiss, and the man is weak.And there remain one more victim
in the Vampiire  fold.  One more to swell the grim and grisly
rankks of the Undead!  .  .  .
     Therre is some fascination, surely,  when I am moved  by
tthe mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a
tomb fretteed with age and heavy with the dust  of centuries,
thoough there be that horrid odor such as  the lairs  of  the
Count have haad.  Yes, I was moved.  I, Van Helsing, with all
my puurpose and with my motive for hate.  I was  moved  to  a
yearning for deelay which seemed to paralyze my faculties and
to clogg my very soul. It may have been that the need of nat-
ural  sleep, and  the strange oppression of the air were be-
ginning tto overcome me.  Certain  it  was that I was lapsing
iinto sleep, the open eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet
fascinationn, when  there came through the snow stilled air a
lonng, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like
the  sound  oof a  clarion.  For it was  the voice of my dear
Madamm Mina that I heard.
     Then  I  bbraced  myself again  to  my  horrid task, and
found bby wrenching away tomb tops one other of  the sisters,
the other dark  one.  I dared not pause to look on her as  I
had on  hher sister, lest  once more I should begin to be en-
tthrall.  But I go on searching until, presently, I find in a
high great  tomb  as if made  to one much beloved that  other
faiir sister which,like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself
out of the attoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so
radiaantly beautiful,so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very
instinct of mann in me,which calls some of my sex to love and
to prottect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion.
But God be thanked, that soul wail of my dear Madam Mina had
not died  out  of  my  ears.  And, before the spell  could be
wwrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work.
By this tiim e I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so
faar  as I  could  tell.  And as there had been only three of
these Undeadd phantoms around us in the night, I took it that
therre were no more of active Undead existent.  There was one
great tomb morre lordly than all the rest.  Huge it  was, and
nobly  proportioned.  On it was but one word.

      DRACULULA

     This thehen was the Undead home of the  King  Vampire, to
whom  so many more were due.  Its emptiness spoke eloquent to
make certain whhat I knew.  Before I began to  restore  these
women tto their dead selves through my awful work,  I laid in
Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and  so  banished him from
it, Undeaad, for ever.
      Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it.  Had  it
been but one,  it had been easy, comparative.  But three!  To
begin  twice more after I had been through a deed of  horror.
For it was terriible with the sweet Miss Lucy,  what would it
not be wwith these strange ones who had survived through cen-

turies, and who had been strenghtened by  the passing of the
years.  Whho would, if they could, have fought for their foul
liives  .  .  .
      Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work.  Had I not
been nerved byy thoughts of other dead,and of the living over
whom hhung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone  on.  I
tremble and tremmble even yet, though  till all was over, God
be thankked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in

the first place,and the gladness that stole over it just ere
the final  dissolution came, as realization that the soul had
beeen won, I could not have gone further with my butchery.  I
could not haave  endured  the  horrid screeching as the stake
drovve home,the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody
foam.  I shoulld have fled in terror and left my work undone.
But itt is over!  And the poor souls, I can pity them now and
weep,  as I  thiink  of them placid each in her full sleep of
death foor a short moment ere fading. For, friend John,hardly

had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body
began to mmelt away  and crumble into  its  native  dust,  as
thhough the death that  should have  come centuries agone had
at last asseert himself and say at once and loud,"I am here!"
      Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances  that
never more cann the Count enter there Undead.
      When I  stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept,
she woke  fromm  her sleep  and, seeing me, cried out in pain
that II had endured too much.
     "Come!"" she said, "come away from this awful place! Let
us ggo to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us."
She was lookinng thin and pale and weak.  But  her  eyes were
pure aand glowed with fervor.  I was glad to see her paleness
and her illness,, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of
that rudddy vampire sleep.
     And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go
eastward  to meet our friends, and him, whom Madam Mina  tell
mme that she know are coming to meet us.

         MININA HARKER'S JOURNAL

     6 Novembeber.--It was late in the afternoon when the Pro-
fessorr and  I  took our  way towards the  east whence I knew
Jonathan was comming.  We did not go fast, though the way was
steeply   downhill, for w e had to take heavy rugs  and wraps

with us.  We dared not face  the  possibility of  being left
without waarmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some
off our provisions too, for we were in a perfect  desolation,
and so far   as  we could see through the snowfall, there was
not  even the sign of habitation.  When  we  had gone about a
mile,I was tirred with the heavy walking and sat down to rest.
Then   we  looked back and  saw where the clear line of Drac-
ula's castle cuut the sky. For we were so deep under the hill
whereonn it was set that the angle of perspective of the Car-
pathian mountains  was  far below it.  We  saw it in all its
grandeur,, perched a  thousand  feet on the summit of a sheer
pprecipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the
steep of thhe adjacent mountain on any side.  There was some-
thiing wild  and  uncanny about the place.  We could hear the
distant howliing of wolves.  They were far off, but the sound,
evenn  though  coming  muffled through the deadening snowfall,
was full of tterror.  I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was
searcching  about that he was  trying to  seek some strategic
point, where wee would be less exposed in case of attack. The
rough rroadway still led downwards. We could trace it through
the drifted snow.
     In a littlee while the Professor signalled  to me, so  I
got up aand joined him.  He had found a wonderful spot,a sort

of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway
between twwo boulders.  He took me by the hand and drew me in.
      "See!" he said,"here you will be in shelter. And if the
wolves do ccome I can meet them one by one."
      He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me,and
got out somee provisions and forced them upon me. But I could
not  eat, to even try to do so was repulsive to me,  and much
as I would havve liked to please him,I could not bring myself
to thee attempt.  He looked very sad, but did not reproach me.
Taking his fielld glasses from the case, he  stood on the top
of the  rock, and began to search the horizon.
     Suddenly  he called out,  "Look!  Madam Mina,look!Look!"
     II sprang up and stood beside him on the rock. He handed
me his glasses aand pointed.  The snow was now  falling  more
heavily,, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was be-

ginning to blow.  However, there were times when  there were
pauses bettween the snow flurries and I could see a  long way
roound. From the height where we were it  was possible to see
a great disttance.  And far  off, beyond the  white  waste of
snoww, I  could see the river lying like a  black  ribbon  in
kinks and curlls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us
and noot far off, in fact so near  that I wondered we had not
noticed before,  came a group of mounted men  hurrying along.
In the mmidst of them was a  cart,  a long leiter wagon which

swept from side to side,like a dog's tail wagging, with each
stern ineqquality of  the road.  Outlined against the snow as
thhey were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were
peasants or  gypsies of some kind.
     On the ccart was a great square chest.  My heart  leaped
as I  saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. The evening
was now drawingg close, and well I knew that  at  sunset  the
Thing,  which was till then imprisoned there, would  take new
freedom and could in any of many forms elude pursuit.In fear
I turned  to the Professor.  To my consternation, however, he
wwas not there.  An instant later, I saw him below me.  Round
the rock hee had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter
in  last night.
      When he  had completed it he stood beside me again say-
ing, "At least  you shall be safe here from him!" He took the
glassess from me, and at the next lull of the  snow swept the
whole space below us. "See,"he said,"they come quickly. They
are floggging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can."
      He paused and went on in a hollow voice, "They are rac-
ing for thee sunset. We may be too late. God's will be done!"
Dowwn  came  another blinding rush of driving  snow,  and the
whole landscaape was blotted  out.  It soon  passed, however,
and oonce more his glasses were fixed on the plain.
     Thhen came a sudden cry,  "Look!  Look!  Look!  See, two
horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south.  It  must be
Quincey aand John. Take the glass. Look before the snow blots
iit all out!"  I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr.
Seward and  Mr. Morris.  I knew at all events that neither of
theem was Jonathan. At the same time I knew that Jonathan was
not far off.   Looking around I saw on the  north side of the
cominng party two  other men, riding at breakneck speed.  One
of them I knew  was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course,
to be  Lord Godalming. They too, were pursuing the party with
the cart.  When  I told the Professor he shouted in glee like
a schoollboy, and  after looking  intently  till a  snow fall

made sight impossible,he laid his Winchester rifle ready for
use againsst the boulder at the opening of our shelter.
     "Thhey are all converging," he said."When the time comes

we shall have gypsies on all sides."  I got out my  revolver
ready to hhand, for whilst  we were speaking the  howling  of
woolves came louder and closer.  When the snow storm abated a
moment we loooked again. It was strange to see the snow fall-
ing  in such heavy flakes close to us,  and  beyond,  the sun
shining more   and more  brightly as it sank down towards the
far moountain tops.  Sweeping the glass all around us I could
see here and theere dots moving singly and in twos and threes
and largger numbers.The wolves were gathering for their prey.

     Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited.  The wind
came now iin fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury
ass it swept upon us in circling eddies.  At  times we  could
not see an aarm's length before us.  But at  others,  as  the
holllow sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air
space around uus so that we could see afar  off.  We  had  of
late bbeen so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset,that
we knew with faiir accuracy when it would be.And we knew that
before llong the sun  would set.  It was hard to believe that

by our watches it  was  less  than an hour that we waited in
that rockyy  shelter  before the various bodies began to con-
veerge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more
bitter sweepps, and more steadily from the north.It seemingly
had  driven the snow clouds from us, for with only occasional
bursts,  the   snow fell.  We  could distinguish  clearly the
indiviiduals  of  each  party, the  pursued and the pursuers.
Strangely  enouggh those pursued did  not seem to realize, or
at leastt to care, that they were pursued.  They seemed, how-

ever,to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
and lower  on the mountain tops.
     Closer aand closer they drew. The Professor and I crouc-
hed ddown behind our rock, and  held  our weapons   ready.  I
could see that  he was determined that they  should not pass.
One andd all were quite unaware of our presence.
     All at  once two voices shouted out to, "Halt!"  One was
my JJonathan's, raised in a high key of passion. The other Mr.
Morris' stronng resolute tone  of quiet command.  The gypsies
may nnot have known the language, but there  was no mistaking
the tone, in whhatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinc-
tively  they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming and
Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris
on the otther.  The leader of the gypsies, a splendid looking
ffellow who sat his horse like a centaur,waved them back, and
in  a  fierrce voice gave to his companions some word to pro-
ceeed. They lashed  the horses which sprang forward.  But the
four men raissed their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistak-
able  way commanded them to stop.  At the same moment Dr. Van
Helsing and I rrose behind the rock and  pointed  our weapons
at themm.  Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened
their reins and drew up.  The leader turned to them and gave
a word att which every  man of the gypsy party drew what wea-
ppon he carried,knife or pistol,and held himself in readiness
to attack.   Issue was joined in an instant.
      The leader, with a quick movement of his rein,threw his
horse out inn front, and pointed first to the sun, now  close
downn on the hill tops, and then to the castle,said something
which I did noot understand.  For answer, all four men of our
party  threw themselves from their horses and dashed  towards
the cart.  I shoould have felt terrible fear at  seeing Jona-
than in  such danger, but that the  ardor of battle must have

been upon me as well as the  rest of  them.  I felt no fear,
but only aa wild, surging desire to do something.  Seeing the
quuick movement of our parties,the leader of the gypsies gave
a command. HHis men instantly formed round the cart in a sort
of uundisciplined  endeavor, each one shouldering and pushing
the other in hhis eagerness to carry out the order.
     In the  middst  of this I could see that Jonathan on one
side of   the  ring of  men, and  Quincey on  the other, were

forcing a way  to the  cart.  It was evident that  they were
bent on fiinishing their task before the sun should set.Noth-
inng seemed to stop or even to hinder them.Neither the level-
led weapons  nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front,
nor  the  howling  of  the  wolves  behind,  appeared to even
attract their  attention.  Jonathan's  impetuosity,  and  the
manifeest singleness of his purpose, seemed  to overawe those
in front of him..  Instinctively  they  cowered aside and let
him passs.In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and with

a strength which seemed incredible,raised the great box, and
flung it oover the wheel to the ground.  In the meantime, Mr.
Moorris had  had to use force to pass through his side of the
ring of Szgaany.All the time I had been breathlessly watching
Jonaathan  I  had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing
desperately foorward, and had seen the knives of the  gypsies
flash  as he won a way through them, and they cut at him.  He
had  parried  wiith  his  great  bowie  knife, and at first I
thought  that he too  had come through in safety.  But as  he

sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart,
I could seee that with his left hand he was  clutching at his
siide, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers.He
did not delaay notwithstanding  this,  for  as Jonathan, with
despperate energy, attacked  one end of the chest, attempting
to prize off tthe lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked
the otther frantically  with his bowie.  Under the efforts of
both men  the  llid  began  to  yield.  The nails drew with a
screechiing sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.
      By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered  by
the Winchesteers, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming  and Dr.
Sewarrd, had given in and made no further resistance. The sun
was almost downn on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the
whole ggroup fell upon the snow. I saw the Count lying within
the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling  from
the cart  had scattered over him.  He  was deathly pale, just
llike a waxen image,and the red eyes glared with the horrible
vindictive  look which I knew so well.
     As  I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look

of hate in them turned to triumph.

     But,  on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jona-
than's greeat knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the
thhroat.  Whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris's  bowie knife
plunged intoo the heart.
      It  was  like  a miracle, but before our very eyes, and
almost in the ddrawing  of  a breath, the whole body crumbled
into duust and passed from our sight.
      I shall  be  glad  as  long as I live that even in that
moment of finall dissolution, there was in the face a look of
peace,  such as I never could have imagined might have rested
there.
     The  Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky,

and every  stone  of  its broken battlements was articulated
against thhe light of the setting sun.
     Thhe gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of  the
extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without
a word, aand rode away as if for their lives.  Those who were
uunmounted  jumped upon the leiter wagon and shouted  to  the
horsemen noot to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn
to  a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone.
     Mr. Morrris,  who  had sunk to the ground, leaned on his
elboow, holding his hand pressed to his side. The blood still
gushed throughh his fingers.I flew to him,for the Holy circle
did noot now keep me back, so did the two  doctors.  Jonathan
knelt behind himm and the wounded man  laid  back his head on
his shouulder.  With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my

hand in that of his own which was unstained.
     He  must  have  seen the anguish of my heart in my face,

for he smiled at me and said,  "I  am only too happy to have
been of seervice!  Oh, God!" he cried suddenly, struggling to
a  sitting posture and pointing to me. "It was worth for this
to die!  Loook!  Look!"
     TThe sun  was  now right down upon the mountain top, and
the red gleams ffell  upon  my face, so that it was bathed in
rosy  liight.  With one  impulse  the men sank on their knees

and a deep and earnest "Amen" broke  from  all as their eyes
followed tthe pointing of his finger.
     Thee dying man spoke,  "Now God be thanked that all  has

not been in vain!  See!  The snow is not more stainless than
her foreheead!  The curse has passed away!"
      And,  to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence,
he died, a ggallant gentleman.

       NOTE



     Seven  years  ago we all  went through the flames.  And
the happinness of some  of us  since then  is, we think, well
woorth the pain we endured.  It is an added  joy  to Mina and
to me that   our boy's  birthday is the  same day as that  on
whicch Quincey  Morris died.  His  mother holds,  I know, the
secret belief  that some of our  brave  friend's  spirit  has
passedd into him.  His  bundle  of names links all our little
band of men togeether.  But we call him Quincey.
      In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transyl-
vania, and wwent over the old ground which was, and is, to us
so ffull of vivid and terrible memories.It was almost imposs-
ible to believve that the things which we had seen  with  our
own eyyes and heard  with  our  own ears were  living truths.
Every trace of aall that had been was blotted out. The castle
stood ass before, reared high above a waste of desolation.
      When we got home we were talking of the old time, which
we could all  look back on without despair, for Godalming and
Sewarrd are both happily married.  I took the papers from the
safe where theyy had been ever since our  return so long ago.
We weree struck with the fact, that in all the mass of mater-
ial of which the record is composed,  there  is  hardly  one
authenticc document.Nothing but a mass of typewriting, except
tthe later notebooks of Mina  and Seward and  myself, and Van
Helsing's mmemorandum.  We could hardly ask any one, even did
we   wish to, to  accept these  as proofs of so wild a story.
Van Helsing ssummed it all up as he said, with our boy on his
knee..
     "We want noo proofs. We ask none to believe us! This boy
will somme day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother

is.  Already he knows her sweetness and  loving care.  Later
on he willl understand how some men  so loved her,  that they
diid dare much for her sake.
